<h2>Dedication</h2>
<p style="text-indent:0em;font-variant:small-caps;">To F.A., In the
name of the children of Fox how, this revival of a child&rsquo;s
story written twenty-seven years ago, under the spell of Rotha and
Fairfield, is inscribed by the writer.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>After many years this little book is once more to see the light.
The children for whom it was written are long since grown up. But
perhaps the pleasure they once took in it may still be felt by some
of the Millys and Ollys of to-day. Up in the dear mountain country
which it describes, the becks are still sparkling;
&ldquo;Brownholme&rdquo; still spreads its green steeps and ferny
hollows under rain and sun; the tiny trout still leap in its tiny
streams; and Fairfield, in its noble curve, still girdles the deep
valley where these children played: the valley of Wordsworth and
Arnold&mdash;the valley where Arnold&rsquo;s poet-son rambled as a
boy&mdash;where, for me, the shy and passionate ghost of Charlotte
Bront&euml; still haunts the open door-way of Fox How&mdash;where
poetry and generous life and ranging thought still dwell, and bring
their benediction to the passers-by. &ldquo;Aunt Emma&rdquo; in her
beautiful home, unchanged but for its vacant chairs, is now as she
ever was, the friend of old and young; and the children of to-day
still press to her side as their elders did before them. The parrot
alas! is gone where parrots may; but amid the voices that breathe
around Fox How&mdash;the voices of seventy years&mdash;his mimic
speech is still remembered by the children who teased and loved
him. For love, while love lasts, gives life to all things small and
great; and in those who have once felt it, the love of the
Fairfield valley, of the gray stone house that fronts the fells,
and of them that dwell therein, is &ldquo;not Time&rsquo;s
fool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;Or bends with the remover to
remove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary A. Ward.<br />

<h3>Making Plans</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly, come down! come down directly! Mother wants you.
Do make haste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just coming, Olly. Don&rsquo;t stamp so. Nurse
is tying my sash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Master Olly went on stamping, and jumping up and down
stairs, as his way was when he was very much excited, till Milly
appeared. Presently down she came, a sober fair-haired little
maiden, with blue eyes and a turn-up nose, and a mouth that was
generally rather solemn-looking, though it could laugh merrily
enough when it tried. Milly was six years old. She looked older
than six. At any rate she looked a great deal older than Olly, who
was nearly five; and you will soon find out that she was a good
deal more than a year and a half wiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Olly? What made you shout
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come along, come along;&rdquo; said the little boy,
pulling at his sister&rsquo;s hand to make her run. &ldquo;Mother
wants to tell us something, and she says it&rsquo;s a nice
something, and I kissed her like anyfing! but she wouldn&rsquo;t
tell me without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two children set off running, and they flew down a long
passage to the drawing-room, and were soon scrambling about a lady
who was sitting working by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, monkeys, don&rsquo;t choke me before I tell you my
nice something. Sit on my knee Olly. Now, Milly, guess&mdash;what
have father and I just been talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sending Olly to school, perhaps,&rdquo; said Milly.
&ldquo;I heard Uncle Richard talking about it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be such a nice something,&rdquo; said
Olly, making a long face. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;not
a bit. Boys don&rsquo;t never like going to school. I want to learn
my lessons with mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a little boy that doesn&rsquo;t like learning
lessons with mother very much,&rdquo; said the lady, laughing.
&ldquo;But my nice something isn&rsquo;t sending Olly to school,
Milly. You&rsquo;re quite wrong&mdash;so try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! is it a strawberry tea?&rdquo; cried Milly.
&ldquo;The strawberries are just ripe, I know. Gardener told nurse
so this morning. And we can have tea on the lawn, and ask Jacky and
Francis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, jolly!&rdquo; said Oliver, jumping off his
mother&rsquo;s knee and beginning to dance about. &ldquo;And
we&rsquo;ll gather them ourselves&mdash;won&rsquo;t you let us,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t a strawberry tea even,&rdquo; said his
mother. &ldquo;Now, look here, children, what have I got
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a map&mdash;a map of England,&rdquo; said
Milly, looking very wise. Milly had just begun to learn geography,
and thought she knew all about maps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what happens when father and I look at maps in
the summertime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Milly, slowly, &ldquo;you and father
pack up your things, and go away over the sea, and we stay behind
with nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call <em>that</em> a nice something,&rdquo;
said Olly, standing still again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, <em>are</em> you going away?&rdquo; said
Milly, hanging round her mother&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Milly, and so&rsquo;s father, and so&rsquo;s
nurse&rdquo;&mdash;and their mother began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s nurse?&rdquo; said Milly and Olly together,
and then they stopped and opened two pairs of round eyes very wide,
and stared at their mother. &ldquo;Oh, mother, mother, take us
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how should father and I get on, travelling about
with a pair of monkeys?&rdquo; said their mother, catching hold of
the two children and lifting them on to her knee; &ldquo;we should
want a cage to keep them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, we&rsquo;ll be <em>ever</em> so good! But
where are we going? Oh, do take us to the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the sea! the sea!&rdquo; shouted Olly, careering
round the room again; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have buckets and spades,
and we&rsquo;ll paddle and catch crabbies, and wet our clothes, and
have funny shoes, just like Cromer. And father&rsquo;ll teach me to
swim&mdash;he said he would next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, for that was the name of
Milly&rsquo;s and Oliver&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;No, we are not
going to the sea this summer. We are going to a place mother loves
better than the sea, though perhaps you children mayn&rsquo;t like
it quite so well. We&rsquo;re going to the mountains. Uncle Richard
has lent father and mother his own nice house among the mountains
and we&rsquo;re all going there next week&mdash;such a long way in
the train, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are mountains?&rdquo; said Olly, who had scarcely
ever seen a hill higher than the church steeple. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t be so nice as the sea, mother. Nothing can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re humps, Olly,&rdquo; answered Milly eagerly.
&ldquo;Great, big humps of earth, you know; earth mixed with stone.
And they reach up ever so high, up into the sky. And it takes you a
whole day to get up to the top of them, and a whole day to get down
again. Doesn&rsquo;t it, mother? Fr&auml;ulein told me all about
mountains in my geography. And some mountains have got snow on
their tops all year, even in summer, when it&rsquo;s so hot, and
we&rsquo;re having strawberries. Will the mountains we&rsquo;re
going to, have snow on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. The snow mountains are far away over the sea. But
these are English mountains, kind, easy mountains, not too high for
you and me to climb up, and covered all over with soft green grass
and wild flowers, and tiny sheep with black faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, mother, is there a garden to Uncle Richard&rsquo;s
house, and are there any children there to play with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a delightful garden, full of roses, and
strawberries and grapes, and everything else that&rsquo;s nice. And
it has a baby river all to itself, that runs and jumps and chatters
all through the middle of it, so perhaps Olly may have a paddle
sometimes, though we aren&rsquo;t going to the sea. And the
gardener has got two little children, just about your age, Aunt
Mary says: and there are two more at the farm, two dear little
girls, who aren&rsquo;t a bit shy, and will like playing with you
very much. But who else shall we see there, Milly? Who lives in the
mountains too, near Uncle Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly looked puzzled, but Milly thought a minute, and then said
quickly, &ldquo;Aunt Emma, isn&rsquo;t it, mother? Didn&rsquo;t she
come here once? I think I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she came once, but long ago, when you were quite
small. But now we shall see a great deal of her I hope, for she
lives just on the other side of the mountain from Uncle
Richard&rsquo;s house, in a dear old house, where I spent many,
many happy days when I was small. Great-grandpapa and grandmamma
were alive then. But now Aunt Emma lives there quite alone. Except
for one creature, at least, an old gray poll-parrot, that chatters
away, and behaves as if it were quite sensible, and knew all about
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she got any pussies, mother?&rdquo; asked
Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, two I believe; but they don&rsquo;t get on with
Polly very well, so they live in the kitchen out of the
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like pussies better than pollies,&rdquo; said Olly
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you know about pollies, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pollies bite, I know they do. There was a polly bited
Francis once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and pussies scratch,&rdquo; said Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t, not if you&rsquo;re nicey to
them,&rdquo; said Olly; who was just then very much in love with a
white kitten, and thought there were no creatures so delightful as
pussies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you don&rsquo;t make up your mind about
Aunt Emma&rsquo;s Polly till you&rsquo;ve seen her,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;Now sit down on the rug there and let us have a
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down squatted the children on the floor opposite their mother,
with their little heads full of plans and their eyes as bright as
sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my cart and horse,&rdquo; began Olly;
&ldquo;and my big ball, and my whistle, and my wheelbarrow, and my
spade, and all my books, and the big scrap-book,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Olly,&rdquo; exclaimed Milly.
&ldquo;Nurse could never pack all those up. There&rsquo;d be no
room for our clothes. You can take your whistle, and the top, and
the picture books, and I can take my dolls. That&rsquo;ll be quite
enough, won&rsquo;t it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s fine weather you&rsquo;ll see&mdash;you won&rsquo;t want
any toys. But now, look here, children,&rdquo; and she held up the
map. &ldquo;Shall I show you how we are going to get to the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be like
my geography lesson&mdash;come, Olly. Now mother&rsquo;ll teach
<em>you</em> geography, like Fr&auml;ulein does me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lessons,&rdquo; said Olly, with half a pout,
&ldquo;not fun a bit. It&rsquo;s only girls like lessons&mdash;Boys
never do&mdash;Jacky doesn&rsquo;t, and Francis doesn&rsquo;t, and
I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about it&rsquo;s being lessons, Olly. Come and
see if it isn&rsquo;t interesting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton.
&ldquo;Now, Milly, find Willingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willingham was the name of the town where Milly and Oliver
lived. It is a little town in Oxfordshire, and if you look long
enough on the map you <em>may</em> find it, though I won&rsquo;t
promise you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Milly triumphantly, showing it
to her mother and Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right. Now look here,&rdquo; and Mrs. Norton took a
pencil out of her pocket and drew a little line along the map.
&ldquo;First of all we shall get into the train and go to a place
called&mdash;look, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bletchley,&rdquo; said Milly, following where the pencil
pointed. &ldquo;What an ugly name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly place,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton,
&ldquo;so perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t deserve a better name. And after
Bletchley&mdash;look again, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rugby,&rdquo; said Milly, reading the names as her mother
pointed, &ldquo;and then Stafford, and then Crewe&mdash;what a
funny name, mother!&mdash;and then Wigan, and then Warrington, and
then Lancaster. Ox-en-holme, Kendal, Wind-er-mere. Oh, mother, what
a long way! Why, we&rsquo;ve got right to the top of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit, Milly, and let me tell you something about
these places. First of all we shall get out of the train at
Bletchley, and get into another train that will go faster than the
first. And it will take us past all kinds of places, some pretty
and some ugly, and some big and some small. At Stafford there is an
old castle, Milly, where fierce people lived in old days and fought
their neighbours. And at Crewe we shall get out and have our
dinner. And at Wigan all the trees grow on one side as if some one
had come and given them a push in the night; and at Lancaster
there&rsquo;s another old castle, a very famous one, only now they
have turned it into a prison, and people are shut up inside it.
Then a little way after Lancaster you&rsquo;ll begin to see some
mountains, far, far away, but first you&rsquo;ll see something
else&mdash;just a little bit of blue sea, with mountains on the
other side of it. And then will come Windermere, where we shall get
out and drive in a carriage. And we shall drive right into the
mountains, Olly, till they stand up all round us with their dear
kind old faces that mother has loved ever since she was a
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children looked up wonderingly at their mother, and they saw
her face shining and her eyes as bright as theirs, as if she too
was a child going out for a holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! And, mother,&rdquo; said Olly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
let us take Spot. She can go in my box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Spot was the white kitten, so Milly and mother began to
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you go and ask Spot first, whether she&rsquo;d
like it, Olly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, patting his sunburnt little
face.</p>

<h3>A Journey North</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Milly and Oliver lived at Willingham, a little town in
Oxfordshire, as I have already told you. Their father was a doctor,
and they lived in an old-fashioned house, in a street, with a long
shady garden stretching away behind it. Milly and Oliver loved
their father, and whenever he put his brown face inside the nursery
door, two pairs of little feet went running to meet him, and two
pairs of little hands pulled him eagerly into the room. But they
saw him very seldom; whereas their mother was always with them,
teaching them their lessons, playing with them in the garden,
telling them stories, mending their frocks, tucking them up in
their snug little beds at night, sometimes praising them, sometimes
scolding them; always loving and looking after them. Milly and Olly
honestly believed that theirs was the best mother in the whole
world. Nobody else could find out such nice plays, or tell them
such wonderful stories, or dress dolls half so well. Two little
neighbours of theirs, Jacky and Francis, had a poor sick mother who
always lay on the sofa, and could hardly bear to have her little
boys in the room with her. Milly and Oliver were never tired of
wondering how Jacky and Francis got on with a mother like that.
&ldquo;How funny, and how dreadful it must be. Poor Jacky and
Francis!&rdquo; It never came into their, heads to say, &ldquo;Poor
Jacky&rsquo;s mother&rdquo; too, but then you see they were such
little people, and little people have only room in their heads for
a very few thoughts at a time.</p>
<p>However, Milly had been away from her mother a good deal lately.
About six months before my story begins she had been sent to
school, to a kindergarten, as she was taught to call it. And there
Milly had learnt all kinds of wonderful things&mdash;she had learnt
how to make mats out of paper, blue mats, and pink mats, and yellow
mats, and red mats; she had learned how to make a bit of soft clay
look like a box, or a stool, or a bird&rsquo;s nest with three clay
eggs inside it; she had begun to add up and take away; and, above
all, she had begun to learn geography, and Fr&auml;ulein&mdash;for
Milly&rsquo;s mistress was a German, and had a German
name&mdash;was just now teaching her about islands, and lakes, and
capes, and peninsulas, and many other things that all little girls
have to learn about some time or other, unless they wish to grow up
dunces.</p>
<p>As for Milly&rsquo;s looks, I have told you already that she had
blue eyes and a turn-up nose, and a dear sensible little face. And
she had very thick fair hair, that was always tumbling about her
eyes, and making her look, as nurse told her, like &ldquo;a yellow
owl in an ivy bush.&rdquo; Milly loved most people, except perhaps
John the gardener, who was rather cross to the children, and was
always calling to them not to walk &ldquo;on them beds,&rdquo; and
to be sure not to touch any of his fruit or flowers. She loved her
father and her mother; she loved Olly with all her whole heart,
though he was a tease, she loved her nurse, whom she and Olly
called Nana, and who had been with them ever since Milly was born;
and she loved Fr&auml;ulein, and was always begging flowers from
her mother that she might take them to school for
Fr&auml;ulein&rsquo;s table. So you see Milly was made up of
loving. And she was a thoughtful little girl too, tidy with her
dress, quick and quiet at her lessons, and always ready to sit
still with her fairy-book or her doll, when mother was busy or
tired. But there were two things in which Milly was not at all
sensible in spite of her sensible face. She was much too ready to
cry when any little thing went wrong, and she was dreadfully afraid
of creatures of all sorts. She was afraid of her father&rsquo;s big
dog, she was afraid of the dear brown cow that lived in the field
beyond the garden, she was afraid of earwigs. I am even ashamed to
say she was afraid of spiders. Once she ran away as if a lion were
behind her from a white kitten that pulled her dress with its
frolicsome paws to make her play with it; but that, Milly would
tell you, was &ldquo;when I was little,&rdquo; and she was quite
sure she was a good deal braver now.</p>
<p>Now what am I to tell you about Olly?</p>
<p>Olly was just a round ball of fun and mischief. He had brown
hair, brown eyes, a brown face, and brown hands. He was always
touching and meddling with everything, indoors and out, to see what
was inside it, or what it was made of. He liked teasing Milly, he
liked his walks, he liked his sleep in the morning, he liked his
dinner, he liked his tea, he liked everything in the world, except
learning to read, and that he hated. He could only do one thing
besides mischief. He could sing all kinds of tunes&mdash;quick
tunes, slow tunes, and merry tunes. He had been able to sing tunes
ever since he was quite a tiny baby, and his father and mother
often talked together of how, in about a year, he should be taught
to play on the piano, or perhaps on the violin, if he liked it
better. You might hear his sharp, shrill little voice, singing
about the house and the garden all day long. John the gardener
called it &ldquo;squealin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and told Olly his songs
were &ldquo;capital good&rdquo; for frightening away the birds.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps, you know a little more about Milly and Olly than
you did when I began to tell you about them, and it is time you
should hear of what happened to them on that wonderful journey of
theirs up to the mountains.</p>
<p>First of all came the packing up. Milly could not make up her
mind about her dolls; she had three&mdash;Rose, Mattie, and
Katie&mdash;but Rose&rsquo;s frocks were very dirty, Mattie had a
leg broken, and Katie&rsquo;s paint had been all washed off one wet
night, when Olly left her out on the lawn. Now which of these was
the tidiest and most respectable doll to take out on a visit? Milly
did not know how to settle it.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="images/illus2.png"><img src=

"&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do without my toys, Nana&rsquo;&rdquo;"
width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do without my toys,
Nana&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Nana,&rdquo; she said at last to her nurse, who
was packing the children&rsquo;s trunk, &ldquo;I will take Katie.
Mother always sends us away when we get white faces to make us look
nice and red again; so, perhaps, if I take Katie her colour will
come back too, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will, Miss Milly,&rdquo; said nurse, laughing;
&ldquo;anyhow, you had better give me the doll you want directly,
for it is time I packed all the toys now. Now, Master Olly, you
know I can&rsquo;t let you take all those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For there was Olly dragging along his wheelbarrow heaped up with
toys with one hand, and his cart and horse with a box of bricks
standing up in it with the other. He would not listen to what Milly
said about it, and he would scarcely listen to nurse now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do without my toys, Nana. I <em>must</em>
do mischief if you won&rsquo;t let me take all my toys; I
can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got room for half those, Master Olly, and
you&rsquo;ll have ever so many new things to play with when we get
to Ravensnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be the new children, Olly,&rdquo; said
Milly, &ldquo;and the little rivers and all the funny new
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t toys,&rdquo; said Olly, looking ready
to cry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said nurse, making a place in the box,
&ldquo;bring me your bricks and your big ball, and your
picture-books. There, that&rsquo;s all I can spare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait one minute,&rdquo; said Olly, rushing off; and just
then Mrs. Norton called nurse away to speak to her in the
drawing-room. When nurse came back she saw nobody in the nursery.
Milly had gone out in the garden, Olly was nowhere to be seen. And
who had shut down the trunk, which was open when she left it?
Me-ow, sounded very softly from somewhere close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;Spot! Spot!&rdquo; called nurse.</p>
<p>Me-ow, Me-ow, came again; a sad choky little mew, right from the
middle of the children&rsquo;s trunk. &ldquo;Master Olly and his
tricks again,&rdquo; said nurse, running to the box and opening it.
There, on the top, lay a quantity of frocks that nurse had left
folded up on the floor, thrown in anyhow, with some toys scattered
among them, and the frocks and toys were all dancing up and down as
if they were bewitched. Nurse took out the frocks, and there was
the children&rsquo;s collar-box, a large round cardboard-box with a
lid, jumping from side to side like a box in a fairy tale; and such
dreadful pitiful little mews coming from the inside! Nurse undid
the lid, and out sprang Spot like a flash of lightning, and ran as
if she were running for her life out of the door and down the
stairs, and safe into the kitchen, where she cuddled herself up in
a corner of the fender, wishing with all her poor trembling little
heart that there were no such things in the world as small boys.
And then nurse heard a kind of kicking and scuffling in the china
cupboard, and when she opened it there sat Olly doubled up, his
brown eyes dancing like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, and his little
white teeth grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Nana, she <em>did</em> make a funny me-ow! I just
said to her, Now, Spottie, <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> you like to go
in my box? and she said, Yes; and I made her such a comfy bed, and
then I stuck all those frocks on the top of her to keep her warm.
Why did you let her out, Nana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little mischief,&rdquo; said Nana, &ldquo;do you know
you might have smothered poor little Spot? And look at all these
frocks; do you think I have got nothing better to do than to tidy
up after your tricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nurse never knew how to be very hard upon Olly; so all she
did was to set him up on a high chair with a picture-book, where
she could see all he was doing. There was no saying what he might
take a fancy to pack up next if she didn&rsquo;t keep an eye on
him.</p>
<p>Well, presently all the packing was done, and Milly and Olly had
gone to say good-bye to Fr&auml;ulein, and to Jacky and Francis.
Wednesday evening came, and they were to start early on Thursday
morning. Olly begged nurse to put him to bed very early, that he
might &ldquo;wake up krick&rdquo;&mdash;quick was a word Olly never
could say. So to bed he went at half-past six, and his head had
scarcely touched the pillow two minutes before he had gone
cantering away into dreamland, and was seeing all the sights and
hearing all the delicious stories that children do see and hear in
dreamland, though they don&rsquo;t always remember them when they
wake up. Both Milly and he woke up very early on Thursday morning;
and directly his eyes were open Olly jumped out of bed like an
india-rubber ball, and began to put on his stockings in a terrible
hurry. The noise of his jump woke nurse, and she called out in a
sleepy voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into bed again, Master Olly, directly. It is only
just six o&rsquo;clock, and I can&rsquo;t have you out of bed till
seven. You&rsquo;ll only be under my feet, and in everybody&rsquo;s
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nana, I won&rsquo;t be in <em>anybody&rsquo;s</em>
way,&rdquo; exclaimed Olly, running up to her and scrambling on to
her bed with his little bare toes half way into his stockings.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep still in my bed all such a long time.
There&rsquo;s something inside of me, Nana, keeps jumping up and
down, and won&rsquo;t let me keep still. Now, if I get up, you
know, Nana, I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, indeed!&rdquo; said nurse, kissing his little
brown face, or as much of it as could be seen through his curls.
&ldquo;A nice helping that would be. Come back to bed, sir, and
I&rsquo;ll give you some picture-books till I&rsquo;m ready to
dress you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So back to bed Master Olly went, sorely against his will, and
there he had to stay till nurse and Milly were dressed, and the
breakfast things laid. Then nurse gave him his bath and dressed
him, and put him up to eat his bread and milk while she finished
the packing. Olly was always very quiet over his meals, and it was
the only time in the day when he was quiet.</p>
<p>Presently up rattled the cab, and down ran the children with
their walking things on to see father and John lift the boxes on to
the top; and soon they were saying good-bye to Susan the cook, and
Jenny the housemaid, who were going to stay and take care of the
house while they were away; and then crack went the whip, and off
they went to the station. On the way they passed Jacky and Francis
standing at their gate, and all the children waved their hats and
shouted &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; At the station nurse kept
tight hold of Olly till father had got the tickets and put all the
boxes into the train, and then he and Milly were safely lifted up
into the railway carriage, and nurse and father and mother came
next, with all the bags and shawls and umbrellas.</p>
<p>Such a settling of legs and arms and packages there was; and in
the middle of it &ldquo;whew&rdquo; went the whistle, and off they
went away to the mountains.</p>
<p>But they had a long way to go before they saw any mountains.
First of all they had to get to Bletchley, and it took about an
hour doing that. And oh! what a lovely morning it was, and how
fresh and green the fields looked as the train hurried along past
them. Olly and Milly could see hundreds and thousands of
moon-daisies and buttercups growing among the wet grass, and every
now and then came great bushes of wild-roses, some pink and some
white, and long pools with yellow irises growing along the side;
and sometimes the train went rushing through a little village, and
they could see the little children trotting along to school, with
their books and slates tucked under their arms; and sometimes they
went along for miles together without seeing anything but the
white-and-brown cows in the fields, and the great mother-sheep with
their fat white lambs beside them. The sun shone so brightly, the
buttercups were so yellow, the roses so pink, and the sky so blue,
it was like a fairy world. Olly and Milly were always shouting and
clapping their hands at something or other, for Milly had grown
almost as wild as Olly.</p>
<p>Sh-sh-sh-sh went the train, getting slower and slower till at
last it stopped altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bletchley, Bletchley!&rdquo; shouted Olly, jumping down
off the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; said his father, catching hold of him,
&ldquo;we shall stop five more times before we get to Bletchley; so
don&rsquo;t be impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last came Bletchley, and the children were lifted out
into the middle of such a bustle, as it seemed to Milly. There were
crowds of people at the station, and they were all pushing backward
and forward, and shouting and talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep hold of me, Olly,&rdquo; said Milly, with an anxious
little face. &ldquo;Oh, Nana, don&rsquo;t let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nurse held him fast; and very soon they were through the
crowd, and father had put them safe into their new train, into a
carriage marked &ldquo;Windermere,&rdquo; which would take them all
the way to their journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was like lions and bears, wasn&rsquo;t it,
mother?&rdquo; said Olly, pointing to the crowd in the station, as
they went puffing away. Now, &ldquo;lions and bears&rdquo; was a
favourite game of the children&rsquo;s, a romping game, where
everybody ran about and pretended to be somebody else, and where
the more people played, and the more they ran and pushed and
tumbled about, the funnier, it was. And the running, scrambling
people at the station did look rather as if they were playing at
lions and bears.</p>
<p>And now the children had a long day before them. On rushed the
train, past towns and villages, and houses and trains. The sun got
hotter and hotter, and the children began to get a little tired of
looking out of window. Milly asked for a story-book, and was soon
very happy reading &ldquo;Snow White and Rose Red.&rdquo; She had
read it a hundred times before, but that never mattered a bit. Olly
came to sit on nurse&rsquo;s knee while she showed him pictures,
and so the time passed away. And now the train stopped again, and
father lifted Olly on his knee to see a great church far away over
the houses, and taught him to say &ldquo;Lichfield
Cathedral.&rdquo; And then came Stafford; and Milly looked out for
the castle, and wondered whether the castles in her story-books
looked like that, and whether princesses and fairy godmothers and
giants ever lived there in old times.</p>
<p>After they had left Stafford, Olly began to get tired and
fidgety. First he went to sit on his father&rsquo;s knee, then on
mother&rsquo;s, then on nurse&rsquo;s&mdash;none of them could keep
him still, and nothing seemed to amuse him for long together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and have a sleep, Master Olly,&rdquo; said nurse.
&ldquo;You are just tired and hot. This is a long way for little
boys, and we&rsquo;ve got ever so far to go yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleepy, Nana,&rdquo; said Olly, sitting
straight up, with a little flushed face and wide-open eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep awake like father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s going to sleep, then,&rdquo; said Mr.
Norton, tucking himself up in a shady corner; &ldquo;so you go too,
Olly, and see which of us can go quickest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Olly had seen his father&rsquo;s eyes tight shut, and heard
him give just one little snore&mdash;it was rather a make-believe
snore&mdash;he did let nurse draw him on to her knee; and very soon
the little gipsy creature was fast asleep, with all his brown curls
lying like a soft mat over nurse&rsquo;s arm. Milly, too, shut her
eyes and sat very still; she did not mean to go to sleep, but
presently she began to think a great many sleepy thoughts: Why did
the hedges run so fast? and why did the telegraph wires go up and
down as if they were always making curtsies? and was that really
mother opposite, or was it Cinderella&rsquo;s fairy godmother? And
all of a sudden Milly came bump up against a tall blue mountain
that had a face like a man, and cried out when she bumped upon
it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crewe, I declare,&rdquo; exclaimed father, jumping up
with a start. &ldquo;Why, Olly and I have been asleep nearly an
hour! Wake up, children, it&rsquo;s dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse had to shake Olly a great many times before he would open
his sleepy eyes, and then he stood up rubbing them as if he would
rub them quite away. Father lifted him out, and carried him into a
big room, with a big table in it, all ready for dinner, and hungry
people sitting round it. What fun it was having dinner at a
station, with all the grown-up people. Milly and Olly thought there
never was such nice bread and such nice apple-tart. Nothing at home
ever tasted half so good. And after dinner father took them a
little walk up and down the platform, and at last, just as it was
time to get into the train again, he bought them a paper full of
pictures, called the <em>Graphic</em>, that amused Olly for a long
way.</p>
<p>But it was a long long way to Windermere, and poor Milly and
Olly began to get very tired. The trees at Wigan did make them
laugh a little bit, but they were too tired to think them as funny
as they would have thought them in the morning. They are such
comical trees! First of all, the smoke from the smoky chimneys at
Wigan has made them black, and stopped the leaves from growing, and
then the wind has blown them all over on one side, so that they
look like ugly little twisted dwarfs, as if some cruel fairy had
touched them with her wand. But Olly soon forgot all about them;
and he began to wander from one end to the other of the carriage
again, scrambling and jumping about, till he gave himself a hard
knock against the seat; and that made him begin to cry&mdash;poor
tired little Olly. Then mother lifted him on to her knee, and said
to him, very softly, &ldquo;Are you very tired, Olly? Never mind,
poor little man, we shan&rsquo;t be very long now, and we&rsquo;re
all tired, darling&mdash;father&rsquo;s tired, and I&rsquo;m tired;
and look at Milly there, she looks like a little white ghost.
Suppose you be brave, and try a little extra hard to be good. Then
mother&rsquo;ll love you an extra bit. And what do you think we
shall see soon? such a lovely bit of blue sea with white ships on
it. Just you shut your eyes a little bit till it comes, I&rsquo;ll
be sure to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough, after Lancaster, mother gave a little cry, and
Olly jumped up, and Milly came running over, and there before them
lay the dancing windy blue sea, covered over with little white
waves, running and tumbling over each other. And on the other side
of it, what did the children see?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother! what is it?&rdquo; cried Olly, pointing
with his little brown hand far away; &ldquo;is it a fairy palace,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is, Olly; anyway, the hill-fairies live there.
For those are the mountains, the beautiful mountains we are going
to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall we get across the sea to them?&rdquo; asked
Milly, with a puzzled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only a corner of the sea, Milly&mdash;a bay.
Don&rsquo;t you remember bays in your geography? We can&rsquo;t go
across it, but we can go round it, and we shall find the mountains
on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! how fast the train seemed to go now that there was something
to look at. Everywhere mountains were beginning to spring up. And
when they had said good-bye to the sea, the mountains began to grow
taller and taller. What had happened to the houses too? They had
all turned white or gray; there was no red one left. And the fields
had stone walls instead of hedges; and inside the walls there were
small sheep, about as big as the lambs they had seen near Oxford in
the morning.</p>
<p>Oxenholme, Kendal, Windermere. How glad the tired children were
when the train ran slowly down into Windermere station, and they
could jump out and say good-bye to it for a long, long time! They
had to wait a little, till father had found all the boxes and put
them in the carriage that was waiting for them, and then in they
tumbled, nurse having first wrapped them up in big shawls, for it
was evening now, and the wind had grown cold. That was a nice drive
home among the mountains. How tall and dark and quiet they were.
And what was this shining on their left hand, like a white face
running beside them, and peeping from behind the trees? Why, it was
a lake; a great wide lake, with tiny boats upon it, some with white
sails and some without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother! may we go in those boats some day?&rdquo;
shouted Olly, in a little sharp tired voice, and his mother smiled
at him, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How happy mother looked. She knew all the mountains like old
friends, she could tell all their names; and every now and then,
when they came to a house, she and father would begin to talk about
the people who lived in it, just as if they were talking about
people they knew quite well. And now came a little town, the town
of Wanwick mother called it, right among the mountains, with a
river running round it, and a tall church spire. It began to get
darker and darker, and the trees hung down over the road, so that
the children could hardly see. On they went, and Olly was very
nearly asleep again, when the carriage began to crunch over gravel,
and then it stopped, and father called out&mdash;&ldquo;Here we
are, children, here we are at Ravensnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And out they all jumped. What were those bright lights shining?
Olly and Milly hardly knew where they were going as nurse took them
in, and one of Uncle Richard&rsquo;s servants showed them the way
upstairs to the nursery. Such a nice nursery, with candles lit, and
a little fire burning, two bowls of hot bread and milk on the
table, and in the corner two little white beds, as soft and fresh
as nests! In twenty minutes Olly was in one of these little white
beds, and Milly in the other. And you may guess whether they were
long about going to sleep.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter3" name="Chapter3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<h3>Ravensnest</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little souls! How late they are sleeping. They must
have been tired last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said nurse at eight o&rsquo;clock, when she came back into
the nursery from a journey to the kitchen after the breakfast
things, and found the children still fast asleep; so fast that it
looked as if they meant to go on sleeping till dinner-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly!&rdquo; she called softly, shaking her very gently,
&ldquo;Milly, it&rsquo;s breakfast-time, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly began to move about, and muttered something about
&ldquo;whistles&rdquo; and &ldquo;hedges&rdquo; in her sleep.</p>
<p>Then nurse gave her another little shake, and at last
Milly&rsquo;s eyes did try very hard to open&mdash;&ldquo;What is
it? What do you want, Nana? Where are we?&mdash;Oh, I
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And up sprang Milly in a second and ran to the window, her
sleepy eyes wide open at last. &ldquo;Yes, there they are! Come and
look, Nana! There, past those trees&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see the
mountains? And there is father walking about; and oh! do look at
those roses over there. Dress me quick, dress me quick, please,
dear Nana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thump! bump! and there was Olly out of bed, sitting on the floor
rubbing his eyes. Olly used always to jump out of bed half asleep,
and then sit a long time on the floor waking up. Nurse and Milly
always left him alone till he was quite woke up. It made him cross
if you began to talk to him too soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; said Olly presently, in a sleepy voice,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going right up the mountains after breakfast.
Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see them, Master Olly,&rdquo; said nurse,
taking him up and kissing him, &ldquo;perhaps your little legs
won&rsquo;t find it quite so easy to climb up the mountains as you
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can climb up three, four, six, seven mountains,&rdquo;
said Olly stoutly; &ldquo;mountains aren&rsquo;t a bit hard. Mother
says they&rsquo;re meant to climb up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s like going up stairs a long
way,&rdquo; said Milly, thoughtfully, pulling on her stockings.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like going up the stairs in Auntie
Margaret&rsquo;s house, Olly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Auntie Margaret&rsquo;s house was a tall London house, with ever
so many stairs. The children when they were staying there were put
to sleep at the top, and Olly used to sit down on the stairs and
pout and grumble every time they had to go up.</p>
<p>But Olly shook his obstinate little head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a bit like going up
stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as they couldn&rsquo;t know what it was like before
they tried, nurse told them it was no good talking about it. So
they hurried on with their dressing, and presently there stood as
fresh a pair of morning children as anyone could wish to see, with
rosy cheeks, and smooth hair, and clean print frocks&mdash;for Olly
was still in frocks&mdash;though when the winter came mother said
she was going to put him into knickerbockers.</p>
<p>And then nurse took them each by the hand and led them through
some long passages, down a pretty staircase, and through a swing
door, into what looked like a great nagged kitchen, only there was
no fireplace in it. The real kitchen opened out of it at one side,
and through the door came a smell of coffee and toast that made the
children feel as hungry as little hunters. But their own room was
straight in front, across the kitchen without a fireplace, a tiny
room with one large window hung round with roses, and looking out
on to a green lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nana, isn&rsquo;t it pretty? Nana, I think it&rsquo;s
lovely!&rdquo; said Milly, looking out and clapping her hands. And
it <em>was</em> a pretty garden they could see from the window. An
up-and-down garden, with beds full of bright flowers, and grass
which was nearly all moss, and so soft that no cushion could be
softer. In the distance they could hear a little splish-splash
among the trees, which came, Milly supposed, from the river mother
had told them about; while, reaching up all round the house, so
that they could not see the top of it from the window, was the
green wild mountain itself, the mountain of Brownholme, under which
Uncle Richard&rsquo;s house was built.</p>
<p>The children hurried through their breakfast, and then nurse
covered them up with garden pinafores, and took them to the
dining-room to find father and mother. Mr. and Mrs. Norton were
reading letters when the children&rsquo;s curly heads appeared at
the open door, and Mrs. Norton was just saying to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma sends a few lines just to welcome us, and to
say that she can&rsquo;t come over to us to-day, but will we all
come over to her to-morrow and have early dinner, and perhaps a row
afterward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a row, mother, a row!&rdquo; shouted Olly, clambering
on to his mother&rsquo;s knee and half-strangling her with his
strong little arms; &ldquo;I can row, father said I might. Are we
going to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to-morrow, Olly, when we&rsquo;ve seen a little bit
of Ravensnest first. Which of you remembers Aunt Emma, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember her,&rdquo; said Milly, nodding her head
wisely, &ldquo;she had a big white cap, and she told me stories.
But I don&rsquo;t quite remember her face, mother&mdash;not
<em>quite</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember her, not one bit,&rdquo; said
Olly. &ldquo;Mother, does she keep saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do
that;&rsquo; &lsquo;Go up stairs, naughty boys,&rsquo; like
Jacky&rsquo;s aunt does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the children&rsquo;s playfellows, Jacky and Francis, had an
aunt living with them whom Milly and Olly couldn&rsquo;t bear. They
believed that she couldn&rsquo;t say anything else except
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go up stairs!&rdquo; and they
were always in dread lest they should come across an aunt like
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the dearest aunt in the whole world,&rdquo;
said mother, &ldquo;and she never says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
except when she&rsquo;s obliged, but when she does say it little
boys have to mind. When I was a little girl I thought there was
nobody like Aunt Emma, nobody who could make such plans or tell
such splendid stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, mother, can&rsquo;t she cut out card dolls? asked
Milly. Don&rsquo;t you know those beautiful card dolls you have in
your drawer at home&mdash;didn&rsquo;t Aunt Emma make
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course she did. She made me a whole family once
for my birthday, a father and a mother, and two little girls and
two little boys. And each of the children had two paper dresses and
two hats, one for best and one for every day&mdash;and the mother
had a white evening dress trimmed with red, and a hat and a
bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, mother! they&rsquo;re all in your drawer at home,
only one of the little boys has his head broken off. Do you think
Aunt Emma would make me a set if I asked her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Milly. But I believe Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
fingers are just as quick as ever they were. Now, children, father
says he will take you out while I go and speak to cook. Olly, how
do you think we&rsquo;re going to get any meat for you and Milly
here? There are no shops on the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll eat fisses, little fisses like
those!&rdquo; cried Olly, pointing to a plate of tiny red-spotted
fish that father and mother had been having for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Olly,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, laughing;
&ldquo;it would cost a good deal to keep you in trout, sir. I think
we&rsquo;ll try for some plain mutton for you, even if we have to
catch the sheep on the mountains ourselves. But now come along till
mother is ready, and I&rsquo;ll show you the river where those
little fishes lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out ran the children, ready to go anywhere and see anything in
this beautiful new place, which seemed to them a palace of wonders.
And presently they were skipping over the soft green grass, each
holding one of father&rsquo;s hands, and chattering away to him as
if their little tongues would never stop. What a hot day it was
going to be! The sky overhead was deep blue, with scarcely a cloud,
they could hear nothing in the still air but the sleepy cooing of
the doves in the trees by the gate, and the trees and flowers all
looked as if they were going to sleep in the heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, why did that old gentleman at Willingham last
week tell mother that it always rained in the mountains?&rdquo;
asked Milly, looking up at the blue sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find out
before you go home that it does know how to rain here. Sometimes it
rains and rains as if the sky were coming down and all the world
were going to turn into water. But never mind about that
now&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t going to rain to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down they went through the garden, across the road, and into a
field on the other side of it, a beautiful hay-field full of
flowers, with just a narrow little path through it where the
children and Mr. Norton could walk one behind another. And at the
end of the path what do you think they found? Why, a chattering
sparkling river, running along over hundreds and thousands of brown
and green pebbles, so fast that it seemed to be trying to catch the
birds as they skimmed across it. The children had never seen a
river like this before, where you could see right to the very
bottom, and count the stones there if you liked, and which behaved
like a river at play, scrambling and dancing and rushing along as
if it were out for a holiday, like the children themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that for a river, children?&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;Very early this morning, when you little
sleepyheads were in bed, I got up and came down here, and had my
bath over there, look&mdash;in that nice brown pool under the
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; cried both children, dancing round
him. &ldquo;Let us have our baths in the river too. Do ask
Nana&mdash;do, father! We can have our bathing things on that we
had at the sea, and you can come too and teach us to
swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just once perhaps, if mother says yes, and
it&rsquo;s very warm weather, and you get up very <em>very</em>
early. But you won&rsquo;t like it quite as much as you think.
Rivers are very cold to bathe in, and those pretty stones at the
bottom won&rsquo;t feel at all nice to your little toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, father,&rdquo; interrupted Milly, &ldquo;we
could put on our sand shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t we splash!&rdquo; said Olly.
&ldquo;Nurse won&rsquo;t let us splash in our bath, father, she
says it makes a mess. I&rsquo;m sure it doesn&rsquo;t make a
<em>great</em> mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it, shrimp?&rdquo; said Mr.
Norton, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to tidy up. Hush, isn&rsquo;t
that mother calling? Let&rsquo;s go and fetch her, and then
we&rsquo;ll go and see Uncle Richard&rsquo;s farm, where the milk
you had for breakfast came from. There are three children there,
Milly, besides cows and pigs, and ducks and chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back ran Milly and Olly, and there was mother watching for them
with a basket on her arm which had already got some roses lying in
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! where did you get those roses?&rdquo; cried
Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheeler, the gardener, gave them to me. And now suppose
we go first of all to see Mrs. Wheeler, and gardener&rsquo;s two
little children. They live in that cottage over there, across the
brook, and the two little ones have just been peeping over the wall
to try and get a look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up clambered Milly and Olly along a steep path that seemed to
take them up into the mountain, when suddenly they turned, and
there was another river, but such a tiny river, Milly could almost
jump across it, and it was tumbling and leaping down the rocks on
its way to the big river which they had just seen, as if it were a
little child hurrying to its mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, what a lot of rivers,&rdquo; said Olly,
running on to a little bridge that had been built across the little
stream, and looking over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to begin with,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see plenty more before you&rsquo;ve done. But I
can&rsquo;t have you calling this a river, Olly. These baby rivers
are called becks in Westmoreland&mdash;some of the big ones, too,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other side of the little bridge was the gardener&rsquo;s
cottage, and in front of the door stood two funny fair-haired
little children with their fingers in their mouths, staring at
Milly and Olly. One was a little girl who was really about
Milly&rsquo;s age, though she looked much younger, and the other
was a very shy small boy, with blue eyes and straggling yellow
hair, and a face that might have been pretty if you could have seen
it properly. But Charlie seemed to have made up his mind that
nobody ever should see it properly. However often his mother might
wash him, and she was a tidy woman, who liked to see her children
look clean and nice, Charlie was always black. His face was black,
his hands were black, his pinafore was sure to be covered with
black marks ten minutes after he had put it on. Do what you would
to him, it was no use, Charlie always looked as if he had just come
out of the coal-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bessie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton to the little girl,
&ldquo;is your mother in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said Bessie, without taking her fingers out
of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry for that. Do you know when
she&rsquo;s likely to be in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said Bessie again, beginning to eat her
pinafore as well as her fingers. Meanwhile Charlie had been
creeping behind Bessie to get out of Olly&rsquo;s way; for Olly,
who always wanted to make friends, was trying to shake hands with
him, and Charlie was dreadfully afraid that he wanted to kiss him
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, &ldquo;I wanted to
ask her a question. Come away, Olly, and don&rsquo;t tease Charlie
if he doesn&rsquo;t want to shake hands. Can you remember, Bessie,
to tell your mother that I came to see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you remember, too, to ask her if she will let you
and Charlie come down to tea with Miss Milly and Master Olly, this
afternoon, at five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Bessie, getting shyer and shyer, and
eating up her pinafore faster than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bessie,&rdquo; said Milly, softly, taking her
hand.</p>
<p>Bessie stared at her, but didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Olly, having quite failed in shaking hands, was now trying to
kiss Charlie; but Charlie wouldn&rsquo;t have it at all, and every
time Olly came near, Charlie pushed him away with his little fists.
This made Olly rather cross, and he began to try with all his
strength to make Charlie kiss him, when suddenly Charlie got away
from him, and running to a pile of logs of wood which was lying in
the yard he climbed up the logs like a little squirrel, and was
soon at the top of the heap, looking down on Olly, who was very
much astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, <em>do</em> let me climb up too!&rdquo; entreated
Olly, as Mrs. Norton took his hand to lead him away. &ldquo;I want
to climb up krick like that! Oh, do let me try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Olly! come along. We shall never get to the farm
if you stay climbing here. And you wouldn&rsquo;t find it as easy
as Charlie does, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m bigger than Charlie,&rdquo; said Olly,
pouting, as they walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t got such stout legs; and, besides,
Charlie is always out of doors all day long, climbing and poking
about. I daresay he can do outdoor things better than you can.
You&rsquo;re a little town boy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&rsquo;s got a black face,&rdquo; said Olly, who
was not at all pleased that Charlie, who was smaller than he was,
and dirty besides, could do anything better than he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, he hasn&rsquo;t got a Nana always looking
after him as you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he got <em>any</em> Nana?&rdquo; asked Olly,
looking as if he didn&rsquo;t understand how there could be little
children without Nanas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got any nurse but his mother, and Mrs.
Wheeler has a great deal else to do than looking after him. What
would you be like, do you think, Olly, if I had to do all the
housework, and cook the dinner, and mind the baby, and there was no
nurse to wash your face and hands for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should get just like shock-headed Peter,&rdquo; said
Olly, shaking his head gravely at the idea. Shock-headed Peter was
a dirty little boy in one of Olly&rsquo;s picture-books; but I am
sure you must have heard about him already, and must have seen the
picture of him with his bushy hair, and his terrible long nails
like birds&rsquo; claws. Olly was never tired of hearing about him,
and about all the other children in that picture-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a funny little girl Bessie is, mother!&rdquo; said
Milly. &ldquo;Do they always say <em>Naw</em> and <em>Yis</em> in
this country, instead of saying No and Yes, like we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, most of the people that live here do,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;Their way of talking sounds odd and queer at
first, Milly, but when you get used to it you will like it as I do,
because it seems like a part of the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time they had been climbing up a steep path behind the
gardener&rsquo;s house, and now Mr. Norton opened a door in a high
wall, and let the children into a beautiful kitchen-garden made on
the mountain side, so that when they looked down from the gate they
could see the chimneys of Ravensnest just below them. Inside there
were all kinds of fruit and vegetables, but gooseberry bushes and
the strawberries had nothing but green gooseberries and white
strawberries to show, to Olly&rsquo;s great disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t the strawberries red, mother?&rdquo; he
asked in a discontented voice, as if it must be somebody&rsquo;s
fault that they weren&rsquo;t red. &ldquo;Ours at home were
ripe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Olly, I suppose the strawberries know best. All I
can tell you is, that things always get ripe here later than at
Willingham. Their summer begins a little later than ours does, and
so everything gets pushed on a little. But there will be plenty
by-and-by. And suppose just now, instead of looking at the
strawberries, you give just one look at the mountains. Count how
many you can see all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, five,&rdquo; counted Olly. &ldquo;What
great big humps! Should we be able to touch the sky if we got up to
the top of that one, mother?&rdquo; and he pointed to a great blue
mountain where the clouds seemed to be resting on the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you were up there just now, you would be all
among the clouds, and it would seem like a white fog all round you.
So you would be touching the clouds at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly opened his eyes very wide at the idea of touching the
clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, we can&rsquo;t touch the clouds at
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That comes of living in a country as flat as a
pancake,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;Just you wait till we can
buy a tame mountain, and carry it to Willingham with us. Then
we&rsquo;ll put it down in the middle of the garden, and the clouds
will come down to sit on the top of it just as they do here. But
now, who can scramble over that gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the gate at the other end of the garden was locked, and as
the gardener couldn&rsquo;t be found, everybody had to scramble
over, mother included. However, Mr. Norton helped them all over,
and then they found themselves on a path running along the green
mountain side. On they went, through pretty bits of steep
hay-fields, where the grass seemed all clover and moon-daisies,
till presently they came upon a small hunched-up house, with a
number of sheds on one side of it and a kitchen-garden in front.
This was Uncle Richard&rsquo;s farm; a very tiny farm, where a man
called John Backhouse lived, with his wife and two little girls and
a baby-boy. Except just in the hay-time, John Backhouse had no men
to help him, and he and his wife had to do all the work, to look
after the sheep, and the cows, the pigs, the horse, and the
chickens, to manage the garden and the hayfield, and to take the
butter and milk to the people who wanted to buy it. When their
children grew up and were able to help, Backhouse and his wife
would be able to do it all very well; but just now, when they were
still quite small, it was very hard work; it was all the farmer and
his wife could do to make enough to keep themselves and their
children fed and clothed.</p>
<p>Milly and Olly were very anxious to see the farmer&rsquo;s
children and looked out for them in the garden as they walked up to
the house, but there were no signs of them. The door was opened by
Mrs. Backhouse, the farmer&rsquo;s wife, who held a fair-haired
baby in her arms sucking a great crust of brown bread, and when Mr.
and Mrs. Norton had shaken hands with her&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m very pleased to see you here,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Backhouse. &ldquo;John told me you were come (only Mrs.
Backhouse said &lsquo;coom&rsquo;), and Becky and Tiza went down
with their father when he took the milk this morning, hoping they
would catch a sight of your children. They have been just wild to
see them, but I told them they weren&rsquo;t likely to be up at
that time in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;Mine
have been looking out for them as we came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t say, unless
they&rsquo;re in the cherry-tree. Becky! Tiza!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint &ldquo;Yis&rdquo; came from the other end of the garden,
but still Milly and Olly could see nothing but a big cherry-tree
growing where the voice seemed to come from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go along that path, missy, and call again.
You&rsquo;ll be sure to find them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Backhouse,
pointing to the tree. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you come in,
ma&rsquo;am, and rest a bit? You&rsquo;ll be maybe tired with
walking this hot day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mr. and Mrs. Norton went into the farmhouse, and the children
went hand-in-hand down the garden, looking for Becky and Tiza.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as they came close to the cherry-tree, they heard a
laugh and a little scuffling, and looking up, what should they see
but two little girls perched up on one of the cherry-tree branches,
one of them sewing, the other nursing a baby kitten. Both of them
had coloured print bonnets, but the smaller had taken hers off and
was rolling the kitten up in it. The little girl sewing had a
sensible, sober face; as for the other, she could not have looked
sober if she had tried for a week of Sundays. It made you laugh
only to look at Tiza. From the top of her curly head to the soles
of her skipping little feet, she was the sauciest, merriest,
noisiest creature. It was she who was always playing tricks on the
cows and the horse, and the big sheep-dogs; who liked nothing so
well as teasing Becky and dressing up the kittens, and who was
always tumbling into the milkpail, or rolling downstairs, or losing
herself in the woods, without somehow ever coming to any harm. If
she and Olly had been left alone in the world together they
<em>must</em> have come to a bad end, but luckily each of them had
wiser people to take care of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becky,&rdquo; said Milly, shyly, looking up into the
tree, &ldquo;will you come down and say how do you do to
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becky stuck her needle in her work and scrambled down with a red
shy face to shake hands; but Tiza, instead of coming down, only
climbed a little higher, and peeped at the others between the
branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came down to the house when fayther took the milk this
morning,&rdquo; said Becky. &ldquo;We thought maybe we&rsquo;d see
you in the garden. Only Tiza said she&rsquo;d run away if she did
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Tiza come down?&rdquo; asked Olly,
looking hard up into the tree. &ldquo;I want to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thump! What was that rattling down on Olly&rsquo;s head? He
looked down at his feet very much astonished, and saw a bunch of
green cherries which Tiza had just thrown at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw some more! Throw some more!&rdquo; he cried out,
and Tiza began to pelt him fast, while Olly ran here and there
picking them up, and every now and then trying to throw them back
at Tiza; but she was too high up for him to reach, and they only
came rattling about his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t come down,&rdquo; said Becky, looking up
at her sister. &ldquo;Maybe she won&rsquo;t speak to you for two or
three days. And if you run after her she hides in such queer places
you can never find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mother wants you and her to come to tea with us this
afternoon,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t Tiza
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose mother&rsquo;ll make her,&rdquo; said Becky,
&ldquo;but she doesn&rsquo;t like it. Have you been on the
fell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly looked puzzled. &ldquo;Do you mean on the mountain? No,
not yet. We&rsquo;re going to-morrow when we go to Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s. But we&rsquo;ve been to the river with
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go over the stepping-stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
they are. Can we go this evening after tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re just
close by your house. Does your mother let you go in the
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Becky said a great many of these words very funnily, so that
Milly could hardly understand her. She said &ldquo;doos&rdquo; and
&ldquo;oop,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knaw,&rdquo; and &ldquo;jist,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;la-ike,&rdquo; but it sounded quite pretty from her soft
little mouth, and Milly thought she had a very nice way of
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother doesn&rsquo;t let us go in the water here, at
least, not unless it&rsquo;s very warm. We paddle when we go to the
sea, and some day father says we may have our bath in the river if
it&rsquo;s very fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never have a bath in the river,&rdquo; said Becky,
looking very much astonished at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have your bath in the nursery like we do?&rdquo;
asked Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got a nursery,&rdquo; said Becky,
staring at her, &ldquo;mother puts us in the toob on Saturday
nights. I don&rsquo;t mind it but Tiza doesn&rsquo;t like it a bit.
Sometimes she hides when it&rsquo;s Saturday night, so that mother
can&rsquo;t find her till it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a bath except on Saturday?&rdquo;
said Milly. &ldquo;Olly and I have one every morning. Mother says
we should get like shock-headed Peter if we
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about him,&rdquo; said Becky, shaking
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little boy in a picture-book. I&rsquo;ll
show him you when you come to tea. But there&rsquo;s mother
calling. Come along, Olly. Tiza won&rsquo;t come down Becky
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very rude girl,&rdquo; said Olly, who was
rather hot and tired with his game, and didn&rsquo;t think it was
all fun that Tiza should always hit him and he should never be able
to hit Tiza. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sit next her when she comes to
tea with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza&rsquo;s only in fun,&rdquo; said Becky,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s always like that. Tiza, are you coming down? I
am going to get baby out, I heard him crying just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you take baby out all by yourself?&rdquo; asked
Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I always take him out, and I put him to sleep at
nights; and mother says he won&rsquo;t go to sleep for anybody as
quick as for me,&rdquo; said Becky proudly.</p>
<p>Milly felt a good deal puzzled. It <em>must</em> be funny to
have no Nana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you and he,&rdquo; said Becky, pointing to Olly,
&ldquo;come up this afternoon and help us call the cows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we may,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;who calls
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza and I,&rdquo; answered Becky; &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m
a big girl I shall learn how to milk, but fayther says I&rsquo;m
too little yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I lived at a farm,&rdquo; said Milly
disconsolately.</p>
<p>Becky didn&rsquo;t quite know what to say to this, so she began
to call Tiza again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swish!&rdquo; went something past them as quick as
lightning. It was Tiza running to the house. Olly set out to run
after her as fast as he could run, but he came bang up against his
mother standing at the farmhouse door, just as Tiza got safely in
and was seen no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t catch Tiza, master,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Backhouse, patting his head; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a rough girl,
always at some tricks or other&mdash;we think she ought to have
been a boy, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, isn&rsquo;t Becky very nice?&rdquo; said Milly,
as they walked away. &ldquo;Her mother lets her do such a lot of
things&mdash;nurse the baby, and call the cows, and make pinafores.
Oh, I wish father was a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not a bad kind of life when the sun
shines, and everything is going right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton;
&ldquo;but I think you had better wait a little bit till the rain
comes before you quite make up your mind about it,
Milly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Milly was quite sure she knew enough about it already to
make up her mind, and all the way home she kept saying to herself,
&ldquo;If I could only turn into a little farmer&rsquo;s girl! Why
don&rsquo;t people have fairy godmothers now like
Cinderella?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Out On The Hills</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Milly and Olly, and the four little Westmoreland children, had a
very pleasant tea together in the afternoon of the Nortons&rsquo;s
first day at Ravensnest. Bessie and Charlie certainly didn&rsquo;t
talk much; but Tiza, when once her mother had made her come,
thought proper to get rid of a great deal of her shyness, and to
chatter and romp so much that they quite fell in love with her, and
could not be persuaded to go anywhere or do anything without her.
Nurse would not let Milly and Olly go to call the cows, though she
promised they should some other day; but she took the whole party
down to the stepping-stones after tea, and great fun it was to see
Becky and Tiza running over the stepping-stones, and jumping from
one stone to another like little fawns. Milly and Olly wanted
sorely to go too, but there was no persuading Nana to let them go
without their father to fish them out if they tumbled in, so they
had to content themselves with dangling their legs over the first
stepping-stone and watching the others. But perhaps you don&rsquo;t
quite known what stepping-stones are? They are large high stones,
with flat tops, which people put in, a little way apart from each
other, right across a river, so that by stepping from one to the
other you can cross to the opposite side. Of course they only do
for little rivers, where the water isn&rsquo;t very deep. And they
don&rsquo;t always do even there. Sometimes in the river Thora,
where Milly and Olly&rsquo;s stepping-stones were, when it rained
very much, the water rose so high that it dashed right over the
stepping-stones and nobody could go across. Milly and Olly saw the
stepping-stones covered with water once or twice while they were at
Ravensnest; but the first evening they saw them the river was very
low, and the stones stood up high and dry out of the water. Milly
thought that stepping-stones were much nicer than bridges, and that
it was the most amusing and interesting way of getting across a
river that she knew. But then Milly was inclined to think
everything wonderful and interesting at Ravensnest&mdash;from the
tall mountains that seemed to shut them in all around like a wall,
down to the tiny gleaming wild strawberries, that were just
beginning to show their little scarlet balls on the banks in the
Ravensnest woods. Both she and Olly went to bed after their first
day at Ravensnest with their little hearts full of happiness, and
their little heads full of plans. To-morrow they were to go to Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s, and perhaps the day after that father would take them
to bathe in the river, and nurse would let them go and help Becky
and Tiza call the cows. Holidays <em>were</em> nice; still
geography lessons were nice too sometimes, thought Milly sleepily,
just as she was slipping, slipping away into dreamland, and in her
dreams her faithful little thoughts went back lovingly to
Fr&auml;ulein&rsquo;s kind old face, and to the capes and islands
and seas she had been learning about a week ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flowers Milly gathered for her mother&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The next morning Mr. and Mrs. Norton were busy indoors till
about twelve o&rsquo;clock; and the children wandered about the
garden with nurse, finding out many new nooks and corners,
especially a delightful steep path which led up and up into the
woods, till at last it took the children to a little brown
summer-house at the top, where they could sit and look over the
trees below, away to the river and the hay-fields and the
mountains. And between the stones and this path grew the prettiest
wild strawberries, only, as Milly said, it was not much good
looking for them yet, for there were so few red ones you could
scarcely get enough to taste what they were like. But in a week or
two, she and Olly planned that they would take up a basket with
some green leaves in it, and gather a lot for father and
mother&mdash;enough for regular dessert&mdash;and some wild
raspberries too, for these also grew in the wood, to the great
delight of the children, who had never seen any before. They began
to feel presently as if it would be nothing very extraordinary to
find trees covered with barley sugar or jam tarts in this wonderful
wood. And as for the flowers Milly gathered for her mother, they
were a sight to see&mdash;moon-daisies and meadow-sweet, wild roses
and ragged-robins, and bright bits of rhododendrons. For both the
woods and the garden at Ravensnest were full of rhododendrons of
all colours, pink and red, and white and flame colour; and Milly
and Olly amused themselves with making up bunches of different
coloured flowers with as many different colours in them as they
could find. There were no rhododendrons at Willingham; and the
children thought them the loveliest, gayest things they had ever
seen.</p>
<p>But at last twelve o&rsquo;clock came. Nurse tidied the
children, gave them some biscuits and milk, and then sent them to
the drawing-room to find father and mother. Only Mrs. Norton was
there, but she said there was no need to wait for father, as he was
out already and would meet them on the way. They were to go
straight over the mountain instead of walking round by the road,
which would have taken much longer. So off they set&mdash;Olly
skipping, and chattering as he always did; while Milly stuck close
to her mother, telling her every now and then, when Olly left off
talking, about their morning in the wood, the flowers they had
gathered and the strawberries they had found. At the top of the
garden was a little gate, and beside the gate stood Bessie and
Charlie, who had really been watching for the children all the
morning, though they didn&rsquo;t dare to come into the garden
without leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessie, we are going to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
Milly, running up to them. &ldquo;Where are you and Charlie going
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nawhere,&rdquo; said Bessie, who, as usual, had her
pinafore in her mouth, and never said more than one word at a time
if she could help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere! what do you do all the morning,
Bessie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bessie, gravely looking
up at her; &ldquo;sometimes I mind the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind the baby, too? Dear, dear! And what does
Charlie do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nawthing,&rdquo; said Bessie again. &ldquo;He only makes
himself dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go to school ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but mother&rsquo;s going to send us,&rdquo; said
Bessie, whose big eyes grew round and frightened at the idea, as if
it was a dreadful prospect. &ldquo;Are you going to be away for all
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we shan&rsquo;t be back till quite evening, mother
says. Here she is. Good-bye, Bessie; good-bye, Charlie. Will you
come and play with us to-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie nodded, but Charlie ran off without answering; for he saw
Olly coming, and was afraid he might want to kiss him. On the other
side of the gate they had to begin to climb up a steep bit of soft
green grass; and very hard work it was. After quite a little way
the children began to puff and pant like two little steam
engines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> a little bit like going upstairs,
don&rsquo;t you think, Olly?&rdquo; said Milly, sitting down by her
mother on a flat bit of gray stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t a bit like going upstairs,&rdquo; said
Olly, shaking his head; for Olly always liked contradicting Milly
if he could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like&mdash;it&rsquo;s
like&mdash;walking up a house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they heard far above them a shout of
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; Both the children started up and looked about
them. It was like father&rsquo;s voice, but they couldn&rsquo;t see
him anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; again. And this time it sounded much nearer
to them. Where could it be? The children began to run about and
look behind the bushes and the rocks, till all of a sudden, just as
Milly got near a big rock, out jumped Mr. Norton from behind it
with a great shout, and began to run after her. Away ran Milly and
Olly as fast as their small feet could carry them, up and down, up
and down, till at last there came a steep place&mdash;one of
Milly&rsquo;s feet tripped up, down she went, rolling over and
over&mdash;down came Olly on the top of her, and the two of them
rolled away together till they stopped at the bottom of the steep
place, all mixed up in a heap of legs and arms and hats and
pinafores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a boy and girl tied up in a knot,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, scrambling down after them and lifting them up.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm done, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bump on my arm,&rdquo; said Milly,
turning up her sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got a scratch on my nose,&rdquo; said
Olly, rubbing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much for a nice tumble like that,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t mind another, would you,
Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Milly, merrily skipping along
beside him. &ldquo;Hide again, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another day, not now, for we want to get to Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s. But tomorrow, if you like, we&rsquo;ll come up here
and have a capital game. Only we must choose a nice dry place where
there are no bogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are bogs?&rdquo; asked Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet places, where your feet go sinking deeper and deeper
into the mud, and you can&rsquo;t find any stiff firm bit to stand
on. Sometimes people sink down and down into a bog till the mud
comes right over their head and face and chokes them; but we
haven&rsquo;t got any bogs as bad as that here. Now, children, step
along in front. Very soon we shall get to the top of the mountain,
and then we shall see wonderful things on the other
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Milly and Olly ran on, pushing their way through the great
tall fern, or scampering over the short green grass where the
little mountain sheep were nibbling, and where a beautiful creeping
moss grew all over the ground, which, mother told Milly, was called
&ldquo;Stags&rsquo; horn moss,&rdquo; because its little green
branches were so like stags&rsquo; horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look, children,&rdquo; shouted their father to them
from behind. &ldquo;Here we are at the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden, instead of only the green mountain
and the sheep, they could see far away on the other side of the
mountain. There, all round them, were numbers of other mountains;
and below, at their feet, were houses and trees and fields, while
straight in front lay a great big blue lake stretching away ever so
far, till it seemed to be lost in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, look, mother!&rdquo; cried Milly, clapping her
hands, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Windermere lake, the lake we saw when
we were coming from the station. Look at that steamer, with all the
people on board! What funny little black people. And oh, mother,
look at that little boat over there! How can people go out in such
a weeny boat as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t such a weeny boat, Milly. It only looks so
small because it&rsquo;s such a long way off. When father and I
take you and Olly on the lake, we shall go in a boat just like
that. And now, instead of looking so far away, look just down here
below you, and tell me what you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some chimneys, and some trees, and some smoke, ever so
far down,&rdquo; shouted the children. &ldquo;Is it a house,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Aunt Emma&rsquo;s house, the old house where
I used to come and stay when I was a little girl, and when your
dear great-grandfather and great-grandmother were alive. I used to
think it the nicest place in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you a very little girl, mother, and were you ever
naughty?&rdquo; asked Milly, slipping her little hand into her
mother&rsquo;s and beginning to feel rather tired with her long
walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was very often naughty, Milly. I used
to get into great rages and scream, till everybody was quite tired
out. But Aunt Emma was very good to me, and took a great deal of
pains to cure me of going into rages. Besides, it always did
naughty children good to live in the same house with
great-grandmamma, and so after a while I got better. Take care how
you go, children, it&rsquo;s very steep just here, and you might
soon tumble over on your noses. Olly, take care! take care! where
<em>are</em> you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where, indeed, was Olly going? Just the moment before the little
man had spied a lovely flower growing a little way off the path, in
the middle of some bright yellow-green moss. And without thinking
of anything but getting it, off he rushed. But oh! splish, splash,
splish, down went Olly&rsquo;s feet, up splashed the muddy water,
and there was Olly stuck in a bog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, pull me out, pull me out!&rdquo; cried the little
boy in terror, as he felt his feet stuck fast. But almost before he
could speak there was father close beside him, standing on a round
little hump of dry grass which was sticking up out of the bog, and
with one grip he got hold of Olly under his arm, and then jump! on
to another little hump of grass, jump! on to another, and there
they were safe on the path again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you black boy!&rdquo; cried father and mother and
Milly all together. Was there ever such a little object! All his
nice clean holland frock was splashed with black mud; and what had
happened to his stockings?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got mud-stockings on,&rdquo; shouted Olly,
capering about, and pointing to his legs which were caked with mud
up to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice respectable boy to take out to
dinner,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll leave
you on the mountain to have dinner with the sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, father,&rdquo; pleaded Milly, taking Olly fast by
the hand. &ldquo;We can wash him at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go too close to him, Milly!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Norton, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll get as black as he is. We shall
have to put him under the pump at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s
quite certain. But there&rsquo;s nothing to wash him with here, so
he must just go as he is for a bit. Now, Olly, run along and your
feet will soon dry. Father&rsquo;s going first, you go next, just
where he goes, I&rsquo;m coming after you, and Milly shall go last.
Perhaps in that way we shall get you down safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, mother, look at my flower,&rdquo; said Olly,
holding it up triumphantly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a
beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you what it&rsquo;s called, Olly? It&rsquo;s
called a butterwort, and it always grows in boggy places; I
wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to go after one again without asking
father first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very different thing going down the mountain from
climbing up it. It seemed only a few minutes before they had got
almost to the bottom, and there was a gate leading into a road, and
a little village of white houses in front of them. They walked up
the road a little way, and then father opened a big gate and let
them into a beautiful garden full of rhododendrons like the
Ravensnest garden. And who was this walking down the drive to meet
them? Such a pretty little elderly lady, with gray hair and a white
cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt Emma!&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, running up to
her and taking both her hands and kissing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lucy,&rdquo; said the little lady, holding her
hands and looking at her (Lucy was Mrs. Norton&rsquo;s Christian
name), &ldquo;it <em>is</em> nice to see you all here. And
there&rsquo;s dear little Milly, I remember her. But where&rsquo;s
Olly? I&rsquo;ve never seen that small creature, you know. Come,
Olly, don&rsquo;t be shy. Little boys are never shy with Aunt
Emma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except when they tumble into bogs,&rdquo; said Mr.
Norton, laughing and pulling Olly forward, who was trying to hide
his mud-stockings behind his mother. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clean
tidy boy to bring to dinner, isn&rsquo;t he, Aunt Emma? I think
I&rsquo;ll take him to the yard and pump on him a little before we
bring him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Emma put up her spectacles to look at Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Olly, I think Mother Quiverquake has been catching
hold of you. Don&rsquo;t you know about old Mother Quiverquake, who
lives in the bogs? Oh, I can tell you splendid stories about her
some day. But now catch hold of my hand, and keep your little legs
away from my dress, and we&rsquo;ll soon make a proper boy of you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Aunt Emma took one of Milly&rsquo;s hands and one of
Olly&rsquo;s, and up they went to the house. But I must start
another chapter before I begin to tell you what the children saw in
Aunt Emma&rsquo;s house, and of the happy time they spent
there.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter5" name="Chapter5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<h3>Aunt Emma&rsquo;s Picnic</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Instead of taking them straight into the house, however, Aunt
Emma took the children up a little shady path which very soon
brought them to a white cottage covered with honeysuckle and
climbing roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where my coachman&rsquo;s wife lives,&rdquo; said
Aunt Emma, &ldquo;and she owns a small boy who might perhaps find
you a pair of stockings, Olly, to put on while your own are
washed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly opened his brown eyes very wide at the idea of wearing some
other little boy&rsquo;s stockings, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>Aunt Emma tapped at the door, and out came a stout kind-looking
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tyson, do you think your Johnny could lend my little
nephew a pair of his stockings while we get his own washed? Master
Olly has been tumbling into a bog by way of making friends with the
mountains, and I don&rsquo;t quite know how I am to let those legs
into my dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, ma&rsquo;am, but Johnny&rsquo;ll be proud if
he&rsquo;s got any clean, but I&rsquo;ll not answer for it.
Won&rsquo;t ye come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In they walked, and there was a nice tidy kitchen, with a wooden
cradle in the corner, and a little fair-haired boy sitting by it
and rocking the baby. This was Johnny, and Olly looked at him with
great curiosity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got bigger legs than
Johnny,&rdquo; he whispered solemnly at last to Aunt Emma, while
they were waiting for Mrs. Tyson, who had gone upstairs to fetch
the stockings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you eat more bread and milk than Johnny
does,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, very solemnly too, &ldquo;However,
most likely Johnny&rsquo;s stockings will stretch. How&rsquo;s the
baby, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great deal better, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
the little boy, smiling at her. Milly and Olly made him feel shy,
but he loved Aunt Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been taking care of her all the morning for
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, and she&rsquo;s never cried but
once,&rdquo; said Johnny proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done! Ah! there comes Mrs. Tyson. Now, Olly, sit up
on that chair, and we&rsquo;ll see to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off came the dirty stockings, and Mrs. Tyson slipped on a pair
of woolen socks that tickled Olly very much. They were very thick,
and not a bit like his own stockings; and when he got up again he
kept turning round and round to look at his legs, as if he
couldn&rsquo;t make them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they feel funny to you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Tyson,
patting his shoulder. &ldquo;Never you mind, little master; I know
they&rsquo;re nice and warm, for I knitted them myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother buys our stockings in the shop,&rdquo; said Olly,
when they got outside again; &ldquo;why doesn&rsquo;t Mrs.
Tyson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we haven&rsquo;t so many shops, or such nice ones
here, Olly, as you have at Willingham; and the people here have
always been used to do a great many things for themselves. Some of
them live in such lonely places among the mountains that it is very
difficult for them to get to any shops. Not very long ago the
mothers used to make all the stuffs for their own dresses and their
children&rsquo;s. What would you say, Milly, if mother had to weave
the stuff for it every time you had a new dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother wouldn&rsquo;t give me a great many new
dresses,&rdquo; said Milly, gravely, shaking her head. &ldquo;I
like shops best, Aunt Emma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s best to like what we&rsquo;ve
got,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, laughing.</p>
<p>Indoors, Olly&rsquo;s muddy stockings were given to Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s maid, who promised to have them washed and dried by
the time they had to go home, and then, when Mrs. Norton had
covered up the black spots on his frock with a clean pinafore she
had brought with her, Olly looked quite respectable again.</p>
<p>The children thought they had never seen quite such a nice house
as Aunt Emma&rsquo;s. First of all it had a large hall, with all
kinds of corners in it, just made for playing hide-and-seek in; and
the drawing-room was full of the most delightful things. There were
stuffed birds in cases, and little ivory chessmen riding upon ivory
elephants. There were picture-books, and there were mysterious
drawers full of cards and puzzles, and glass marbles and
old-fashioned toys, that the children&rsquo;s mother and aunts and
uncles, and their great-aunts and uncles before that, had loved and
played with years and years ago. On the wall hung a great many
pictures, some of them of funny little stiff boys in blue coats
with brass buttons, and some of them of little girls with mob-caps
and mittens, and these little boys and girls were all either dead
now, or elderly men and women, for they were the great-aunts and
uncles; and over the mantelpiece hung a picture of a lovely old
lady, with bright, soft brown hair and smiling eyes and lips, that
looked as if they were just going to speak to the two strange
little children who had come for their first visit to their
mother&rsquo;s old home. Milly knew quite well that it was a
picture of great-grandmamma. She had seen others like it before,
only not so large as this one, and she looked at it quietly, with
her grave blue eyes, while Olly was eagerly wandering round the
room, spying into everything, and longing to touch this, that, and
the other, if only mother would let go his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who that is, don&rsquo;t you, little
woman?&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, taking her up on her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Milly, nodding, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
great-grandmamma. I wish we could have seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could, Milly. She would have smiled at you as
she is smiling in the picture and you would have been sure to have
loved her; all little children did. I can remember seeing your
mother, Milly, when she was about as old as you, cuddled up in a
corner of that sofa over there, in &lsquo;grandmamma&rsquo;s
pocket,&rsquo; as she used to call it, listening with all her ears
to great-grandmamma&rsquo;s stories. There was one story called
&lsquo;Leonora&rsquo; that went on for years and years, till all
the little children in it&mdash;and the little children who
listened to it&mdash;were almost grown up; and then
great-grandmamma always carried about with her a wonderful
blue-silk bag full of treasures, which we used to be allowed to
turn out whenever any of us had been quite good at our lessons for
a whole week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother has a bag like that,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;it
has lots of little toys in it that father had when he was a little
boy. She lets us look at it on our birthdays. Can you tell stories,
Aunt Emma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about old Mother Quiverquake,&rdquo; cried Olly,
running up and climbing on his aunt&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; said Aunt Emma; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
much too fine to-day for stories&mdash;indoors, at any rate. Wait
till we get a real wet day, and then we&rsquo;ll see. After dinner
to-day, what do you think we&rsquo;re going to do? Suppose we have
a row on the lake to get water-lilies, and suppose we take a kettle
and make ourselves some tea on the other side of the lake. What
would you say to that, Master Olly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children began to dance about with delight at the idea of a
row and a picnic both together, when suddenly there was a knock at
the door, and when Aunt Emma said, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; what do
you think appeared? Why, a great green cage, carried by a servant,
and in it a gray parrot, swinging about from side to side, and
cocking his head wickedly, first over one shoulder and then over
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, while the children
stood quite still with surprise, &ldquo;let me introduce you to my
old friend, Mr. Poll Parrot. Perhaps you thought I lived all alone
in this big house. Not at all. Here is somebody who talks to me
when I talk to him, who sings and chatters and whistles and cheers
me up wonderfully in the winter evenings, when the rains come and
make me feel dull. Put him down here, Margaret,&rdquo; said Aunt
Emma to the maid, clearing a small table for the cage. &ldquo;Now,
Olly, what do you think of my parrot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it talk?&rdquo; asked Olly, looking at it with very
wide open eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>can</em> talk; whether it <em>will</em> talk is
quite another thing. Parrots are contradictious birds. I feel very
often as if I should like to beat Polly, he&rsquo;s so provoking.
Now, Polly, how are you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s got a bad cold; fetch the doc&mdash;&rdquo;
said the bird at once, in such a funny cracked voice, that it made
Olly jump as if he had heard one of the witches in Grimm&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fairy Tales&rdquo; talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Polly, that&rsquo;s very well behaved of you; but
you mustn&rsquo;t leave off in the middle, begin again. Olly, if
you don&rsquo;t keep your fingers out of the way Polly will snap
them up for his dinner. Parrots like fingers very much.&rdquo; Olly
put his hands behind his back in a great hurry, and mother came to
stand behind him to keep him quiet. By this time, however, Polly
had begun to find out that there were some new people in the room
he didn&rsquo;t know, and for a long time Aunt Emma could not make
him talk at all. He would do nothing but put his head first on one
side and then on the other and make angry clicks with his beak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Polly,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;what a cross
parrot you are. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four. Now, Polly,
count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s got a bad cold, fetch the doc&mdash;&rdquo;
said Polly again while Aunt Emma was speaking.
&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;two&mdash;<em>
Quick</em> march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Polly began to lift first one claw and then the other
as if he were marching, while the children shouted with laughter at
his ridiculous ways and his gruff cracked voice.</p>
<p>Then Aunt Emma went behind him and rapped gently on the table.
The parrot stopped marching, stuck his head on one side and
listened. Aunt Emma rapped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said the parrot suddenly, quite softly,
as if he had turned into quite another person.
&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh, cat&rsquo;s got a mouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Polly,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;I suppose she
may have a mouse if she likes. Is that all you&rsquo;ve got to tell
us? Polly, where&rsquo;s gardener?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away! get away!&rdquo; screamed Polly, while all his
feathers began to stand up straight, and his eyes looked fierce and
red like two little live coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That always makes him cross,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma;
&ldquo;he can&rsquo;t bear gardener. Come, Polly, don&rsquo;t get
in such a temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he like the witches on the broom-sticks
in our fairy-book, Olly?&rdquo; cried Milly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think, Aunt Emma, he must have been changed into something? Perhaps
he was a wicked witch once, or a magician, you know, and the
fairies changed him into a parrot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, I can&rsquo;t say. He was a parrot when I
had him first, twelve years ago. That&rsquo;s all I know about it.
But I believe he&rsquo;s very old. Some people say he&rsquo;s older
than I am&mdash;think of that! So you see he&rsquo;s had time to be
a good many things. Well, Polly, good-night. You&rsquo;re not a
nice bird to-night at all. Take him away, Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane! Jane!&rdquo; screamed Polly, as the maid lifted up
the cage again. &ldquo;Make haste, Jane! cat&rsquo;s in the
larder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you bad Polly,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re always telling tales. Jane&rsquo;s my cook,
Milly, and Polly doesn&rsquo;t like cats, so you see he tries to
make Jane believe that our old cat steals the meat out of the
larder. Good-bye, Polly, good-bye. You&rsquo;re an ill-natured old
bird, but I&rsquo;m very fond of you all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do get us a parrot, mother!&rdquo; said Olly, jumping
about round his mother, when Polly was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many more things will you want before you get home,
Olly, do you think?&rdquo; asked his mother, kissing him.
&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll want to take home a few mountains, and
two or three little rivers, and a bog or two, and a few
sheep&mdash;eh, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time dinner was ready, and there was the dinner-bell
ringing. Up ran the children to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s room to get their
hands washed and their hair brushed, and presently there were two
tidy little folks sitting on either side of Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
chair, and thinking to themselves that they had never felt quite so
hungry before. But hungry as Milly was she didn&rsquo;t forget to
look out of the window before she began her dinner, and it was
worth while looking out of the window in Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
dining-room.</p>
<p>Before the windows was a green lawn, like the lawn at
Ravensnest, only this lawn went sloping away, away till there was
just a little rim of white beach, and then beyond came the wide,
dancing blue lake, that the children had seen from the top of the
mountain. Here it was close to them, so close that Milly could hear
the little waves plashing, through the open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; whispered Aunt Emma when they were all
waiting for pudding, &ldquo;do you see that little house down there
by the water&rsquo;s edge? That&rsquo;s where the boat
lives&mdash;we call it a boathouse. Do you think you&rsquo;ll be
frightened of the water, little woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Milly, shaking
her little wise head gravely. &ldquo;I am frightened sometimes,
very. Mother calls me a little goose because I run away from Jenny
sometimes&mdash;that&rsquo;s our cow at home, Aunt Emma, but then
she&rsquo;s got such long horns, and I can&rsquo;t help feeling
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the lake hasn&rsquo;t got horns, Milly,&rdquo; said
Aunt Emma, laughing, &ldquo;so perhaps you will manage not to be
afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How kind and nice Aunt Emma looked as she sat between the
children, with her pretty soft gray hair, and her white cap and
large white collar. Mrs. Norton could not help thinking of the
times when she was a little girl, and used always to insist on
sitting by Aunt Emma at dinner-time. That was before Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s hair had turned gray. And now here were her own little
children sitting where she used to sit at their age, and stealing
their small hands into Aunt Emma&rsquo;s lap as she used to do so
long ago.</p>
<p>After dinner the children had to sit quiet in the drawing-room
for a time, while Aunt Emma and father and mother talked; but they
had picture-books to look at, and Aunt Emma gave them leave to turn
out everything in one of the toy-drawers, and that kept them busy
and happy for a long time. But at last, just when Olly was
beginning to get tired of the drawer, Aunt Emma called to them from
the other end of the room to come with her into the kitchen for a
minute. Up jumped the children and ran after their aunt across the
hall into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, pointing to a big
basket on the kitchen table, &ldquo;suppose you help me to pack up
our tea-things. Olly, you go and fetch the spoons, and, Milly,
bring the plates one by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea things were all piled up on the kitchen table, and the
children brought them one after another to Aunt Emma to pack them
carefully into the big basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a useful boy, Aunt Emma?&rdquo; asked Olly
proudly, coming up laden with a big table-cloth which he could
scarcely carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very useful, Olly, though our table-cloth won&rsquo;t
look over tidy at tea if you crumple it up like that. Now, Milly,
bring me that tray of bread and the little bundle of salt; and,
Olly, bring me that bit of butter over there, done up in the green
leaves, but mind you carry it carefully. Now for some knives too;
and there are the cups and saucers, Milly, look, in that corner;
and there is the cake all ready cut up, and there is the bread and
butter. Now have we got everything? Everything, I think, but the
kettle, and some wood and some matches, and these must go in
another basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Milly, creeping up close to her,
&ldquo;were you ever a fairy godmother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of, Milly. Would you like me better if I
had a wand and a pair of pet dragons, like old Fairy
Blackstick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Milly, stroking her aunt&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;but you do such nice things, just like fairy godmothers
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I, little woman? Aunt Emma likes doing nice things for
good children. But now come along, it&rsquo;s quite time we were
off. Let us go and fetch father and mother. Gardener will bring the
baskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a merry party they were, trooping down to the boathouse.
There lay the boat; a pretty new boat, painted dark blue, with a
little red flag floating at her bows, and her name,
&ldquo;Ariel,&rdquo; written in large white letters on the stern.
And all around the boathouse stretched the beautiful blue water, so
clear and sunny and sparkling that it dazzled Milly&rsquo;s eyes to
look at it. She and Olly were lifted into the boat beside Aunt Emma
and mother, father sat in the middle and took the oars, while
gardener put the baskets into the stern, and then, untying the rope
which kept the boat tied into the boathouse, he gave it a good push
with one hand and off she went out into the blue lake, rising up
and down on the water like a swan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! mother, mother, look up there,&rdquo; shouted Olly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the mountain. Isn&rsquo;t that where we
climbed up this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there it was, the beautiful green rocky mountain, rising up
above Aunt Emma&rsquo;s house. They could see it all so clearly as
they got farther out into the lake; first the blue sky, then the
mountain with the little white dots on it, which Milly knew were
sheep; then some trees, and in front, Aunt Emma&rsquo;s house with
the lawn and the boathouse. And as they looked all round them they
could see far bigger and grander mountains than Brownholme, some
near and green like Brownholme, and some far away and blue like the
sky, while down by the edge of the lake were hayfields full of
flowers, or bits of rock with trees growing on the top of them. The
children hardly knew what it was made them so quiet; but I think it
was because everything was so beautiful. They were really in the
hill-fairies&rsquo; palace now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any water-fairies in this lake,
mother?&rdquo; whispered Milly, presently, looking down into the
clear blue water, and trying to see the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, Milly, I never saw any. But there
used to be water-fairies in old days. After tea suppose we ask Aunt
Emma to tell us a story about a king in olden times whom the
water-fairies loved; she used to tell it to me when I was small,
and I liked it best of all stories. But, Olly, you must sit still,
or the boat will go tipping over to one side, and father
won&rsquo;t be able to row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me row, father,&rdquo; begged Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, old man&mdash;I must get used to the boat first,
and find out how to manage her, but presently you shall come and
try, and so shall Milly if she likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they rowed, farther and farther from the shore, till Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s house began to look quite small, and they could hardly
see the gardener working on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, what a long way we&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; cried
Milly, looking all round. &ldquo;Where are we going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, presently, Milly, I am going to turn the boat a
little bit, so as to make her go over to that side of the lake over
there. Do you see a big rock with some trees on it, far away,
sticking out into the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the children, looking very hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going to have tea.
It&rsquo;s called Birdsnest Point, because the rocks come out in a
point into the lake. But first I thought I would bring you right
out into the middle of the lake, that you might see how big it is,
and look at the mountains all round.&rdquo; &ldquo;Father,&rdquo;
said Olly, &ldquo;if a big stone fell down out of the sky and made
ever such a big hole in the boat, and the water came into the hole,
should we all be dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay we should, Olly, for I don&rsquo;t think I
could carry mother, and Aunt Emma, and Milly, and you on my back,
safe home again, and you see none of you can swim but
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hope a big stone won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said
Milly, feeling just a little bit frightened at Olly&rsquo;s
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, big stones don&rsquo;t grow in the sky generally,
Milly, if that&rsquo;s any comfort to you. But do you know, one day
long ago, when I was out rowing on this lake, I thought all of a
sudden I heard some one shouting and screaming, and for a long time
I looked and waited, but could see nothing; till at last I fancied
I could see, a long distance off, what looked like a pole, with
something white tied to it. And I rowed, and rowed, and rowed, as
fast as I could, and all the time the shouting and screaming went
on, and at last what do you think I saw? I saw a boat, which looked
as if something was dragging it down into the water. Part of it had
already sunk down into the lake, and in the part which was still
above the water there were three people sitting, a gentleman, and
two little girls who looked about ten years old. And they were
shouting &lsquo;Help! help!&rsquo; at the top of their voices, and
waving an oar with a handkerchief tied to it. And the boat in which
they sat was sinking farther and farther into the water, and if I
had&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come up just when I did, the gentleman and the
two little girls would have been drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; cried Milly, &ldquo;what made their
boat do like that? And did they get into yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a great hole in the bottom of their boat,
Milly, and the water was coming through it, and making the boat so
heavy that it was sinking down and down into the lake, just as a
stone would sink if you threw it in. How the hole came there we
never quite knew: I thought they must have knocked their boat
against a sharp rock&mdash;in some parts of the lake there are
rocks under the water which you can&rsquo;t see&mdash;and the rock
had made the hole; but other people thought it had happened in some
other way. However, there they were, and when I took them all into
my boat you never saw such miserable little creatures as the two
little girls were. They were wet through, they were as white as
little ghosts, and when they were safe in my boat they began to cry
and shake so, poor little souls, though their father and I wrapped
them up in our coats, that I did want their mother to come and
comfort them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, father, you took them safe home to their mother,
didn&rsquo;t you? And do tell me what she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had no mother, Milly, they had only their father,
who was with them. But he was very good to them, and I think on the
whole they were happy little girls. The Christmas after that I got
a little parcel one morning, and what do you think was in it? Why,
two photographs of the same little girls, looking so neat and tidy
and happy, I could hardly believe they were really the same as the
little drowned rats I had pulled out of the water. Ask mother to
show you the pictures when we get home; she has them somewhere.
Now, Olly, would you like to row?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, don&rsquo;t bump against any rocks,&rdquo;
said Milly, whose thoughts were very full of the little girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble your head about rocks, old woman.
I know a good deal more about this lake than those little
girls&rsquo; father did, and I won&rsquo;t take you into any harm.
Come along, Olly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly was helped along the boat by mother and Aunt Emma till his
father caught hold of him and pulled him on to his seat, where he
let him put his two small paws on one of the oars, and try what he
could do with it. Mr. Norton pulled too; but Olly thought it was
all his doing, and that it was really he who was making the boat
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we go fast, father?&rdquo; he cried out
presently, his little face flushed with pleasure and excitement.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t row so fast without me, could you,
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little fly-on-the-wheel,&rdquo; said his father,
smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;re bigger.
But now look, children, how close we are coming to the shore. And
quick, Milly, quick! What do you see over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Norton pointed over the water to a place where some green
rushes were standing up out of the water, not very far from the
edge. What were those great white and gold things shining among the
rushes; and what were those large round green leaves lying on the
water all about them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water-lilies! water-lilies!&rdquo; cried Milly, stamping
her little feet with delight. &ldquo;Oh, mother, look! it was on
one of those leaves that the old toad put little Tiny in my
fairy-book, don&rsquo;t you remember? Only the little fishes came
and bit off the stalk and set her free. Oh, I wish we could see
little Tiny sitting on one of those leaves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
saying what you may find in these parts if you look long enough.
This is a very strange country. But now, Milly, look out for the
lilies. Father&rsquo;s going to take us in among them, and
I&rsquo;ll hold you, while you gather them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And presently, swish went the boat up against the rushes, and
there were the lovely white lilies lying spread out on the water
all round them, some quite open and showing their golden middles,
and some still buds, with their wet green cases just falling off,
and their white petals beginning to unclose. But what slippery
stalks they had. Aunt Emma held Milly, and father held Olly, while
they dived their hands under the water and pulled hard. And some of
the lilies came out with such short bits of stalk you could
scarcely hold them, and sometimes, flop! out came a long green
stalk, like a long green snake curling and twisting about in the
boat. The children dabbled, and splashed, and pulled, to their
hearts&rsquo; content, till at last Mr. Norton told them they had
got enough and now they must sit quite still while he rowed them in
to the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, just those two over there!&rdquo; pleaded
Milly, who could not bear leaving so many beauties behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Milly, no more. Look where the sun is now. If we
don&rsquo;t make haste and have our tea, we shall never get back to
Ravensnest to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly&rsquo;s face looked as if it would like to cry, as the
boat began to move away from the rushes, and the beautiful lilies
were left behind. I told you, to begin with, that Milly was ready
to cry oftener than a sensible little girl should. But Aunt Emma
was not going to have any crying at her picnic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to gather me sticks to make my
fire?&rdquo; she said suddenly, in a solemn voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am! I am!&rdquo; shouted both the children at once, and
out came Milly&rsquo;s smiles again, like the sun from behind a
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to lay the table-cloth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are! we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to hand the bread and
butter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; exclaimed Milly, &ldquo;and Olly shall hand
the cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to <em>eat</em> the bread and
butter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us!&rdquo; shouted the children, and Milly added,
&ldquo;Father will want a <em>big</em> plate of bread and butter, I
daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he would, after all this rowing,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;Now then, look out for a bump!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="images/illus4.png"><img src=
"images/illus4.png" alt=
"&ldquo;So they put Olly up on a tall piece of rock, and he sang.&rdquo;"
id="illus4" name="illus4" width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;So they put Olly up on a tall piece of rock, and he
sang.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bump! Splash! there was the boat scraping along the pebbles near
the shore; out sprang Mr. Norton, first on to a big stone, then on
to the shore, and with one great pull he brought the boat in till
it was close enough for Aunt Emma and Mrs. Norton to step on to the
rocks, and for the children to be lifted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what a nice place!&rdquo; cried Milly, looking about
her, and clapping her hands, as she always did when she was
pleased. It was a point of rock running out into the lake, a
&ldquo;peninsula&rdquo; Milly called it, when she had been all
round it, and it was covered with brown heather spread all over the
ground, and was delightfully soft and springy to sit upon. In the
middle of the bit of rock there were two or three trees standing up
together, birch trees with silvery stems, and on every side but one
there was shallow brown water, so clear that they could see every
stone at the bottom. And when they looked away across the lake,
there were the grand old mountains pushing their heads into the
clouds on the other side, and far away near the edge of the lake
they saw a white dot which they knew was Aunt Emma&rsquo;s house.
How the sun shone on everything! How it made the water of the lake
sparkle and glitter as if it were alive! And yet the air was not
hot, for a little wind was coming to them across the water, and
moving the trees gently up and down.</p>
<p>And what was this under the trees? Why, a kind of fireplace made
of stones, and in front of it a round green bit of grass, with
tufts of heather all round it, just like a table with seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put these stones here, Aunt Emma?&rdquo; asked Olly,
as she and mother and Mr. Norton brought up the baskets, and put
them in the green place by the stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Olly, long ago, when all your uncles and aunts were
little, and they used to come here for picnics, they thought it
would be very nice to have a stone fireplace, built up properly, so
that they needn&rsquo;t make one every time. It was Uncle
Richard&rsquo;s idea, and we had such fun building it up. The
little ones brought the stones; and the big ones piled them
together till you see we made quite a nice fireplace. And it has
lasted ever since. Whenever I come here I mend it up if any of the
stones have tumbled down. Numbers of little children come to picnic
here every summer, and they always use our fireplace. But now, come
along into the woods, children, and gather sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off they ran after Aunt Emma, and soon they were scrambling
about the wood which grew along the shore, picking up the dry
sticks and dry fern under the trees. Milly filled her cotton frock
full, and gathered it up with both her hands; while Olly of course
went straight at the biggest branch he could see, and staggered
along with it, puffing and panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You grasshopper, you!&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, catching
hold of him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better try a
whole tree next time? There, let me break it for you.&rdquo; Father
broke it up into short lengths, and then off ran Olly with his
little skirts full to Aunt Emma, who was laden too with an armful
of sticks. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do to begin with, old man. Come
along, and you and I&rsquo;ll light the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What fun it was, heaping up the sticks on the stones, and how
they did blaze and crackle away when Aunt Emma put a match to them.
Puff! puff! out came the smoke;
fizz&mdash;crack&mdash;sputter&mdash;went the dry fir branches, as
if they were Christmas fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we made a blazey fire, Aunt Emma?&rdquo;
said Olly, out of breath with dragging up sticks, and standing
still to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, who had just come out
of the wood with his bundle. &ldquo;Now, Olly, let me just put you
on the top of it to finish it off. How you would fizz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off ran Olly, with his father after him, and they had a romp
among the heather till Mr. Norton caught him, and carried him
kicking and laughing under his arm to Aunt Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Aunt Emma, shall I put him on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;my kettle
wouldn&rsquo;t sit straight on him, and it&rsquo;s just boiling
beautifully. We&rsquo;ll put him on presently when the fire gets
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olly, do come and help mother and me with the
tea-things,&rdquo; cried Milly, who was laying the cloth as busily
and gravely as a little housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along, shrimp,&rdquo; said his father, setting him
down.</p>
<p>And off ran Olly, while Mr. Norton and Aunt Emma heaped the wood
on the fire, and kept the kettle straight, so that it
shouldn&rsquo;t tip over and spill.</p>
<p>Laying the cloth was delightful, Milly thought. First of all,
they put a heavy stone on each corner of the cloth to keep it down,
and prevent the wind from blowing it up, and then they put the
little plates all round, and in the middle two piles of bread and
butter and cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t got any flowers,&rdquo; said Milly,
looking at it presently, with a dissatisfied face, &ldquo;you
always have flowers on the table at home, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Milly, have you forgotten your water-lilies; where
did you leave them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the water,&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;Father told
me just to put their stalks in the water, and he put a stone to
keep them safe. Oh! that&rsquo;ll be splendid, mother. Do give me a
cup, and we&rsquo;ll get some water for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother found a cup, and the children scrambled down to the edge
of the lake. There lay the lilies with their stalks in the water,
close to the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look rather sad, mother, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
said Milly, gathering them up. &ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t like
being taken away from their home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never look so beautiful out of the water,&rdquo;
said mother; &ldquo;but when we get home we&rsquo;ll put them into
a soup-plate, and let them swim about in it. They&rsquo;ll look
very nice then. Now, Olly, fill the cup with water, and we&rsquo;ll
put five or six of the biggest in, and gather some
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, look! look! Aunt Emma,&rdquo; shouted Milly, when
they had put the lilies and some fern leaves in the middle of the
table. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we made it beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you have,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, coming up with the
kettle which had just boiled. &ldquo;Now for the tea, and then
we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never had such a nice tea as this before,&rdquo; said
Olly, presently looking up from a piece of bread and butter which
had kept him quiet for some time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nicer than
having dinner at the railway station even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Emma and mother laughed; for it doesn&rsquo;t seem so
delightful to grown-up people to have dinner at the railway
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Olly,&rdquo; said mother, &ldquo;I hope we shall
often have tea out of doors while we are at Ravensnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll rain, mother. That old
gentleman said it would be sure to rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old gentleman is about right, Milly,&rdquo; said Mr.
Norton. &ldquo;I think it rains dreadfully here, but mother
doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind it a bit. Once upon a time when mother
was a little girl, there came a funny old fairy and threw some
golden dust in her eyes, and ever since then she can&rsquo;t see
straight when she comes to the mountains. It&rsquo;s all right
everywhere else, but as soon as she comes here, the dust begins to
fly about in her eyes, and makes the mountains look quite different
to her from what they look to anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look, mother,&rdquo; said Olly, pulling her down
to him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Norton opened her eyes at him, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any dust, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s fairy dust,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, gravely. &ldquo;Now, Olly, don&rsquo;t you eat too
much cake, else you won&rsquo;t be able to row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be my turn first, father,&rdquo; said Milly,
&ldquo;you know I haven&rsquo;t rowed at all yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you catch any crabs, Milly,&rdquo; said
Aunt Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch crabs, Aunt Emma!&rdquo; said Milly, very much
puzzled. &ldquo;Crabs are only in the sea, aren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very big kind just about here,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re always looking out for
little children, particularly little girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, father,&rdquo; said Milly,
opening her eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some more tea, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton,
&ldquo;that always makes people feel wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, aren&rsquo;t you talking nonsense?&rdquo; said
Olly, stopping in the middle of a piece of cake to think about what
his father was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely, Olly. People always do at picnics. Aunt
Emma, when are you going to tell us your story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve washed the things and put them
away,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;then Olly shall sing us two
songs, and I&rsquo;ll tell you my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the children were so hungry that it was a long time before
they gave up eating bread and butter, and then, when at last tea
was over, what fun it was washing the cups and plates in the lake!
Aunt Emma and Olly washed, and mother and Milly dried the things on
a towel, and then everything was packed away into the baskets, and
mother and Aunt Emma folded up the table-cloth, and put it tidily
on the top of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did like that,&rdquo; said Milly, sighing as the last
basket was fastened down. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let me help
Sarah wash up the tea-things at home, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Sarah liked to let you, I shouldn&rsquo;t say no,
Milly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;How soon would you get tired
of it, old woman, I wonder? But come along, let&rsquo;s put Olly up
on a rock, and make him sing, and then we&rsquo;ll have Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they put Olly up on a tall piece of rock, and he sang
&ldquo;The Minstrel Boy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bonnie Dundee,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Hot Cross Buns,&rdquo; just as if he were a little
musical box, and you had nothing to do but to wind him up. He had a
sweet, clear, little voice, and he looked a delightful brown gipsy,
as he sat perched up on the rock with his long legs dangling, and
his curls blowing about his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Olly, when he had shouted out the last
note of &ldquo;Hot Cross Buns.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have singed three
whole songs; and now, Aunt Emma, tell us about the king and the
fairies. Krick, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be &lsquo;krick&rsquo; indeed,&rdquo; said Aunt
Emma, &ldquo;if we want to get home to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the sun had almost sunk behind the mountains at their back,
and the wind blowing across the lake was beginning to get a little
cold, while over their heads the rooks went flying, singing
&ldquo;caw, caw,&rdquo; on their way to bed. And how the sun was
turning the water to gold! It seemed to be making a great golden
pathway across the lake, and the mountains were turning a deep
blue, and plash, plash, went the little waves on the rocks, so
softly they seemed to be saying &ldquo;Good-night!
good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, settling herself on a soft
piece of heather, and putting her arms round Milly and Olly,
&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a great king. He was a good king
and a wise man, and he tried to make all the people round about him
wiser and better than they were before he came to rule over them;
and for a long time he was very powerful and happy, and he and the
brave men who helped him and were his friends did a great deal of
good, and kept the savage people who lived all about him in order,
and taught them a great many things. But at last some of the savage
people got tired of obeying the king, and they said they would not
have him to reign over them any more; so they made an army, and
they came together against the king to try and kill him and his
friends. And the king made an army too, and there was a great
battle; and the savage people were the strongest, and they killed
nearly all the king&rsquo;s brave men, and the king himself was
terribly hurt in the fight. And at last, when night came on, there
were left only the king and one of his friends&mdash;his knights,
as they were called. The king was hurt so much that he could not
move, and his friend thought he was dying. They were left alone in
a rocky desert place, and close by there was a great lake with
mountains round it&mdash;like this, Olly. It was very cold, and the
moon was shining, and the king lay so still that once or twice his
friend almost thought that he was dead. But at last, about the
middle of the night, he began to speak, and he told his friend to
take his sword that was by his side and to go down to the side of
the lake and throw it as far as he could into the water. Now, this
sword was a magic sword. Long before, the king was once walking
beside this lake, when he suddenly saw an arm in a long white
sleeve rising out of the lake, and in the hand at the end of it was
a splendid sword with a glistening handle. And the king got into a
boat and rowed as fast as he could till he got near enough to take
hold of the sword, and then the arm sank down under the water and
was seen no more. And with the sword the king won a great many
battles, and he loved it, and never would part with it; but now
that he was dying, he told his friend to take the sword and throw
it back into the lake where he had found it, and see what would
happen. And his friend took it, and went away over the rocks till
he came to the edge of the lake, and then he took the sword out of
its case and swung it above his head that he might throw it far
into the water; but as he lifted it up the precious stones in the
handle shone so splendidly in the moonlight that he could not make
up his mind to throw it into the water, it seemed such a pity. So
he hid it away among the rushes by the water side, and went back to
the king. And the king said, &lsquo;What did you see by the
lake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the knight said, &lsquo;I saw nothing except the
water, and the mountains, and the rushes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the king said, &lsquo;Oh, unkind friend! Why will you
not do as I ask you, now that I am dying and can do nothing for
myself? Go back and throw the sword into the lake, as I told
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the knight went back, and once more he lifted the
sword to throw it into the water but it looked so beautiful that he
<em>could</em> not throw it away. There would be nothing left, he
thought, to remember the king by when he was dead if he threw away
the sword; so again he hid it among the rushes, and then he went
back to the king. And again the king asked, &lsquo;What did you see
by the lake?&rsquo; and again the knight answered, &lsquo;I saw
nothing except the water and the mountains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, unkind, false friend!&rsquo; cried the king,
&lsquo;you are crueller to me than those who gave me this wound. Go
back and throw the sword into the water, or, weak as I am, I will
rise up and kill you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back went the knight, and this time he seized the sword
without looking at it, so that he should not see how beautiful it
was, and then he swung it once, twice, thrice, round his head, and
away it went into the lake. And as it fell, up rose a hand and arm
in a long white sleeve out of the water, and the hand caught the
sword and drew it down under the water. And then for a moment, all
round the lake, the knight fancied he heard a sound of sobbing and
weeping, and he thought in his heart that it must be the
water-fairies weeping for the king&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What did you see by the lake?&rsquo; asked the
king again, when he came back, and the knight told him. Then the
king told him to lift him up and carry him on his back down to the
edge of the lake, and when they got there, what do you think they
saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the children could not guess, and Milly pressed Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s hand hard to make her go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They saw a great black ship coming slowly over the water,
and on the ship were numbers of people in black, sobbing and
crying, so that the air was full of a sound of weeping, and in
front sat three queens in long black dresses, and with gold crowns
on their heads, and they, too, were weeping and wringing their
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lift me up,&rsquo; said the king, when the ship
came close beside them, &lsquo;and put me into the ship.&rsquo; And
the knight lifted him up, while the three queens stretched out
their hands and drew him into the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, king! take me with you,&rsquo; said the
knight, &lsquo;take me too. What shall I do all alone without
you?&rsquo; But the ship began to move away, and the knight was
left standing on the shore. Only he fancied he heard the
king&rsquo;s voice saying, &lsquo;Wait for me, I shall come again.
Farewell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ship went faster and faster away into the
darkness, for it was a fairy ship, till at last the knight could
see it no more. So then he knew that the king had been carried away
by the fairies of the lake&mdash;the same fairies who had given him
the sword in old days, and who had loved him and watched over him
all his life. But what did the king mean by saying, &lsquo;I shall
come again&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Aunt Emma stopped and looked at the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he mean, auntie?&rdquo; asked Milly, who had
been listening with all her ears, and whose little eyes were wet,
&ldquo;and did he ever come back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while the knight lived, Milly. He grew to be quite an
old man, and was always hoping that the fairies would bring the
king again. But the king never came, and his friend died without
seeing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did he <em>ever</em> come again?&rdquo; asked
Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Olly. Some people think that he is
still hidden away somewhere by the kind water-fairies, and that
some day, when the world wants him very much, he will come back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he is here in this lake?&rdquo; whispered
Milly, looking at the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we tell what&rsquo;s at the bottom of the
lake?&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, smiling. &ldquo;But no, I don&rsquo;t
think the king is hidden in this lake. He didn&rsquo;t live near
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo; asked Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name was King Arthur. But now, children, hurry; there
is father putting all the baskets into the boat. We must get home
as quick as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rowed home very quickly, except just for a little time when
Milly rowed, and they did not go quite so fast as if father were
rowing alone. It was quite evening now on the lake, and there were
great shadows from the mountains lying across the water. Somehow
the children felt much quieter now than when they started in the
afternoon. Milly had curled herself up inside mother&rsquo;s arm,
and was thinking a great deal about King Arthur and the fairy ship,
while Olly was quite taken up with watching the oars as they dipped
in and out of the water, and occasionally asking his father when he
should be big enough to row quite by himself. It seemed a very
little time after all before they were stepping out of the boat at
Aunt Emma&rsquo;s boathouse, and the picnic and the row were both
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear lake,&rdquo; said Milly, turning with her
hands full of water-lilies to look back before they went up to the
house. &ldquo;Good-night, mountains; good-night, Birdsnest Point. I
shall soon come and see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes more, and they were safely packed into a carriage
which drove them back to Ravensnest, and Aunt Emma was saying
good-bye to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time, I shall come and see you, Milly,&rdquo; she
said, as she kissed Milly&rsquo;s little sleepy face.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget me till then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll tell us about old Mother
Quiverquake,&rdquo; said Olly, hugging her with his small arms.
&ldquo;Aunt Emma, I haven&rsquo;t given Johnny back his stockings.
They did tickle me so in the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them some time,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma.
&ldquo;Good-night, good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sleepy pair of children that nurse lifted out of the
carriage at Ravensnest. And though they tried to tell her something
about it, she had to wait till next morning before she could really
understand anything about their wonderful day at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter6" name="Chapter6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<h3>Wet Days At Ravensnest</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>For about a week after the row on the lake the weather was
lovely, and Milly wondered more than ever what the old gentleman
who warned them of the rain in the mountains could have been
thinking about. She and Olly were out all day, and nearly every
afternoon nurse lifted the tea-table through the low nursery window
on to the lawn, and let them have their tea out of doors among the
flowers and trees and twittering birds. They had found out a
fly-catcher&rsquo;s nest in the ivy above the front door, and every
evening the two children used to fetch out their father to watch
the parent birds catching flies and carrying them to the hungry
little ones, whom they could just hear chirping up above the ivy.
Olly was wild to get the gardener&rsquo;s ladder that he might
climb up and look into the nest, but Mr. Norton would not have it
lest it should frighten away the old birds.</p>
<p>One delicious warm morning, too, the children had their
long-promised bathe, and what fun it was. Nurse woke them up at
five o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;fancy waking up as early as
that!&mdash;and they slipped on their little blue bathing gowns,
and their sand shoes that mother had bought them in Cromer the year
before, and then nurse wrapped them up in shawls, and she and they
and father went down and opened the front door while everybody else
in the house was asleep, and slipped out. What a quiet strange
world it seemed, the grass and the flowers dripping with dew, and
overhead such a blue sky with white clouds sailing slowly about in
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we always get up at five o&rsquo;clock,
father?&rdquo; asked Olly, as he and Milly skipped along&mdash;such
an odd little pair of figures&mdash;beside Mr. Norton.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice and funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;Still, I imagine
Olly, if you had to get up every day at five o&rsquo;clock, you
might think it funny, but I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t always
think it nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m sure we should,&rdquo; said Milly,
seriously. &ldquo;Why, father, it&rsquo;s just as if everything was
ours and nobody else&rsquo;s, the garden and the river I mean. Is
there <em>anybody</em> up yet do you think&mdash;in those
houses?&rdquo; And Milly pointed to the few houses they could see
from the Ravensnest garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, Milly. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
who&rsquo;s sure to be up now, and that&rsquo;s John Backhouse. I
should think he&rsquo;s just beginning to milk the cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh then, Becky and Tiza&rsquo;ll be up too,&rdquo; cried
Milly, dancing about. &ldquo;I wish we could see them. Somehow it
would be quite different seeing them now, father. I feel so queer,
as if I was somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you have ever been up <em>very</em> early on a summer
morning, you will know what Milly meant, but if not I can hardly
explain it. Such a pretty quiet little walk they had down to the
river. Nobody on the road, nobody in the fields, but the birds
chattering and the sun shining, as if they were having a good time
all to themselves, before anybody woke up to interrupt them. Mr.
Norton took the children down to the stepping-stones, and then,
while Milly and nurse stayed on the bank he lifted Olly up, and
carried him to the middle of the stepping-stones, where the water
would about come up to his chest. Mr. Norton had already taken off
his own shoes and stockings, and when they came to the middle
stone, he put Olly down on the stone, and stepped into the water
himself. &ldquo;Now, Olly, give me your hands and jump in. Mind,
it&rsquo;ll feel very cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly shut his eyes, and opened his mouth, as he always did when
he felt just a little frightened, and then in he went; splash! ugh!
it was so cold&mdash;much colder than the sea used to
feel&mdash;but after a few splashes Olly began to get used to it,
and to think it fine fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, fetch Milly, and then we&rsquo;ll all dance
about,&rdquo; entreated Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Milly,&rdquo; called Mr. Norton. &ldquo;Try whether
you can manage the stepping-stones by yourself.&rdquo; So Milly
came, holding up her bathing dress, and stepping from one big stone
to another with a very grave face, as if she felt that there would
be an end of her altogether if she tumbled in. And then, splash! In
she jumped by the side of Olly, and after a little shiver or two
she also began to think that the river was a delightful bathing
place, almost as nice as the sea, perhaps in some ways nicer,
because it was such a strange and funny one. They danced and
splashed about in the brown sparkling water till they were tired,
and at last Olly stopped to take breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the fishes must be frightened of
us,&rdquo; he said, peering down into the river. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see any, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they wouldn&rsquo;t choose to swim about just where
little children are shouting and capering. The fishes are hidden
safe away under the banks and the big stones. Besides, it&rsquo;s
going to be a very hot day, and they like the shady bits of the
river. Just here there&rsquo;s no shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a great commotion in the river, and when Mr.
Norton looked round for a second he could see nothing of Milly,
till up came a dripping head and a pair of hands, and there was
Milly kneeling on the stones at the bottom of the river, with just
her head above water, looking very much astonished and rather
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what happened, old woman?&rdquo; said Mr. Norton,
holding out his hand to help her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t quite know, father; I was
standing on a big stone, and all of a sudden it tipped up, and I
tumbled right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all I thought you was a big fish, and then I
thought you was going to be drowned,&rdquo; said Olly, cheerfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you wasn&rsquo;t drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Milly! Miss Milly!&rdquo; shouted nurse from the
bank, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite time you came out now. If you stay in
so long you&rsquo;ll get cold, and you, too, Master
Olly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly was not inclined to come. He would have liked to go on
dabbling and splashing till breakfast-time, but Mr. Norton hurried
him out, and the two dripping little creatures were well wrapped up
in large shawls which nurse had brought with her. Then nurse took
up Olly in her arms, and father took up Milly, who was small and
light for her age, and they set off up the bit of road to the
house. By this time it was past six o&rsquo;clock, and whom should
they meet at the Ravensnest gate but John Backhouse, with Becky and
Tiza, and his two dogs. He was just bringing the milk, and both he
and his children looked as brisk and wide awake as if they had been
up and about for hours.</p>
<p>Milly and Olly were very much excited at the sight of them, and
Olly struggled hard to get down, but nurse held him tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Becky! we&rsquo;ve had such a nice bathe,&rdquo;
cried Milly, as she passed them muffled up in her shawl, her little
wet feet dangling out.</p>
<p>Becky and Tiza looked longingly after them as they disappeared
into the house. They wished they could have had a bathe too, but
they knew very well that their hard-worked father and mother had
something else to do on a fine summer&rsquo;s morning than to take
them to bathe, and in a few minutes they had forgotten all about
it, and were busy playing with the dogs, or chattering to their
father about the hay-making, which was soon to begin now.</p>
<p>That evening there were strange clouds at sunset time, and Mr.
Norton shook his head as he heard Mrs. Norton arrange to take the
children next day to a small mountain village near Ravensnest, to
call on some old friends of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a plan for to-morrow if I
were you,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;the weather
doesn&rsquo;t look promising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; said Milly, protesting. &ldquo;There
are some red clouds over there&mdash;look! and Nana always says
it&rsquo;s going to be fine when there are red clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, your red clouds may be right and I may be
wrong. We shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, alas! father was quite right. When Milly woke up next
morning there was no nice sunshine creeping on to her bed as it had
done almost ever since they came to Ravensnest; but instead there
was rain beating steadily against the window, coming down out of a
heavy gray sky, and looking as if it meant to go on for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Milly, as she began to dress,
&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t go out, and the wild strawberries will get so
wet. I meant to have gathered some for mother to-day. There would
have been such nice ones in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was no use thinking about woods or strawberries, and when
Mrs. Norton came into the children&rsquo;s room just as they were
finishing breakfast, she found a pair of dull little faces staring
out at the rain, as if looking at it would make it stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasty rain,&rdquo; said Olly, climbing up on his
mother&rsquo;s knee. &ldquo;Go to Spain. I don&rsquo;t want you to
come and spoil my nicey time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid scolding the rain won&rsquo;t make it go
away,&rdquo; said his mother, smiling into his brown face as he
knelt on her lap, with his arms round her neck. &ldquo;Now what are
we going to do to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Milly, sitting down
opposite her mother, and resting her face gravely on her hands.
&ldquo;Well, we brought <em>some</em> toys, you know, mother.
Olly&rsquo;s got his top; I can help him spin it, and I can play
with Katie a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t take very long,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton.
&ldquo;Suppose we do some lessons first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, lessons!&rdquo; said Milly, in a very
doubtful voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s holidays, mother, it&rsquo;s holidays,&rdquo;
cried Olly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like lessons&mdash;not a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, Olly, think a bit; you can&rsquo;t spin your
top and look at picture-books all day, and I&rsquo;m afraid
it&rsquo;s going to rain all day&mdash;it looks very like it. If
you come and do some reading and counting with me this morning, I
can give you some spills to make, or some letters to tear up for me
afterwards. That will save the toys for this afternoon; and some
time this afternoon, if it doesn&rsquo;t stop raining, we&rsquo;ll
all have a romp. And as for you, Milly, don&rsquo;t you think
it&rsquo;s quite time Katie had a new frock? I believe I can find a
beautiful bit of blue silk in my bag, and I&rsquo;m sure nurse will
show you how to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly&rsquo;s face brightened up very much at this, and the two
children went skipping upstairs to the drawing-room after their
mother, in very fair spirits again. Olly did some reading, while
Milly wrote in her copybook, and then Olly had his counting-slate
and tried to find out what 6 and 4 made, and 5 and 3, and other
little sums of the same kind. He yawned a good deal over his
reading, and was quite sure several times that h-a-y spelt
&ldquo;ham,&rdquo; and s-a-w spelt &ldquo;was,&rdquo; but still, on
the whole, he got through very well. Milly wrote her copy, then she
learnt some verses of a poem called &ldquo;Lucy Gray,&rdquo; and
last of all mother found her a big map of Westmoreland, the county
in which the mountains are, and they had a most delightful
geography lesson. Mother pretended to take Milly a drive all about
the mountains, and made her find out their names, and the names of
the towns and the lakes, beginning with Lake Windermere. Olly was
interested too, for Mrs. Norton told them a great many things about
the places, and made quite a story out of it.</p>

width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;He was quite sure that h-a-y spelt &lsquo;ham&rsquo; and
s-a-w spelt &lsquo;was.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, I never could go all that long way all at
once&mdash;<em>really</em>, could I?&rdquo; asked Milly, when they
had been all round the mountains, in and out and round about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Milly, not quite,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, laughing,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very easy to go a long way in a pretendy
drive. It would only take us about ten minutes that way to get to
the other side of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long would it take really?&rdquo; asked Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could fly up, and up, ever so far,&rdquo; said
Olly, standing on tiptoe, and stretching out his little arms as
high as they would reach, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t take us long.
Mother, don&rsquo;t you wish you was a bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so, Olly; why do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I should like to go so <em>krick</em>. Mother,
the fly-catchers do fly so krick; I can&rsquo;t see them sometimes
when they&rsquo;re flying, they go so fast. Oh, I do wish father
would let me get up a ladder to look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Olly, you&rsquo;ll frighten them,&rdquo; said Milly,
putting on her wise face. &ldquo;Besides, father says you&rsquo;re
too little, and you&rsquo;d tumble down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly looked as if he didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it, as he
generally did when Milly talked wisely to him; but just then he
found that mother had put into his lap a whole basketful of letters
to tear up, and that interested him so much that he forgot the
fly-catchers. Nurse cut out a most fashionable blue dress for
Katie, and Milly was quite happy all the rest of the morning in
running up the seams and hemming the bottom. So the morning passed
away. After dinner there were the toys to play with, and
Katie&rsquo;s frock to try on, for nurse had taken a turn at the
body while Milly had been making the skirt. It fitted very well,
and Milly had only the band to put on and the sleeves to make
before it would be quite finished. Then nurse promised to put a
little white lace round the neck, and cut out a blue sash, that
Katie might be quite turned into an elegant young lady. Tea came
very soon, and when it was cleared away father and mother came into
the big kitchen without a fireplace, next to the children&rsquo;s
room, and they all had a splendid romp. Mr. Norton made himself
into a tiger, with a tiger-skin in the hall, that Uncle Richard had
brought home from India, and Olly shot him all over with a
walking-stick from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. When
they were tired of this, mother set them to play hide-and-seek, and
Milly hid herself in such out-of-the-way cupboards, and squeezed
herself into such small corners, that mother said she was like a
needle in a bundle of hay&mdash;there was no finding her.</p>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock came before they had time to think about it,
and the children went chattering and skipping up to bed, though on
fine evenings they had been staying up much later. How the rain did
rattle on the window while they were undressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you tiresome rain,&rdquo; said Milly, standing by the
window in her nightdress, and gazing up into the sky. &ldquo;Where
does it all come from, I wonder? Won&rsquo;t it be wet to-morrow,
Nana? and oh, what is that roaring over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beck,&rdquo; said nurse, who was
brushing Olly&rsquo;s hair, and trying hard to make him stand still
for two minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beck! why, what&rsquo;s the matter with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rain has made it so full I suppose,&rdquo;
said nurse. &ldquo;To-morrow, gardener says, it&rsquo;ll be over
the lawn if the rain goes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it mustn&rsquo;t go on,&rdquo; said Milly.
&ldquo;Now, rain, dear rain, good rain, do go away to-night, right
away up into the mountains. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for you up
there, and down here we don&rsquo;t want you a bit. So do be polite
and go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rain didn&rsquo;t see any good reason for going away, in
spite of Milly&rsquo;s pretty speeches, and next morning there was
the same patter on the window, the same gray sky and dripping
garden. After breakfast there was just a hope of its clearing up.
For about an hour the rain seemed to get less and the clouds a
little brighter. But it soon came on again as fast as ever, and the
poor children were very much disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Milly, when they had settled down to
their lessons again in the drawing-room, &ldquo;when we get back to
Willingham, do you know what I shall do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall ask you to take me to see that old
gentleman&mdash;you know who I mean&mdash;who told you about the
rain. And I shall say to him, &lsquo;please, Mr. Old Gentleman, at
first I thought you were quite wrong about the rain, but afterwards
I thought you were quite right, and it does rain dreadfully much in
the mountains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Milly. But you have only just had a taste of
what the rain can do in the lakes you know, so far. Father and I
have been here sometimes when it has rained two or three weeks
without stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Milly, looking extremely melancholy.
&ldquo;I like the mountains very much, mother; but <em>do</em> you
think we&rsquo;d better come to Ravensnest again after this
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you ungrateful little woman!&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton,
whose love for the place was so real that Milly&rsquo;s speech gave
her quite a pang. &ldquo;Have you forgotten all your happy sunshiny
days here, just because it has rained for two? Why, when I was a
little girl, and used to come here, the rainy days never made me
love the place a bit the less. I always used to think the fine days
made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, mother, you were a nice little girl,&rdquo;
said Milly, throwing her arms round her mother&rsquo;s neck and
kissing her. &ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t feel a bit nice this
morning. It makes me so cross not to be able to go out and get
flowers and wild strawberries. And you know at home it hardly ever
rains all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardener says sometimes it rains all over the
road,&rdquo; interrupted Olly, &ldquo;and people can&rsquo;t walk
along, and they have to go right up on the mountains to get past
the water place. And sometimes they have to get a boat to take
people across. Do you think we shall have to go in a boat to church
on Sunday, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re a long way off that yet, Olly. It will
take a good many days&rsquo; rain to flood the roads so deep that
we can&rsquo;t get along them, and this is only the second rainy
day. Come, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve got much to complain of.
Now suppose, instead of doing all your lessons this morning, you
were presently to write to Jacky and Francis&mdash;you write to
Jacky, Milly, and Olly to Francis. Don&rsquo;t you think that would
be a good thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Milly, shutting up her copybook
in a great hurry. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be so much astonished,
mother, for we didn&rsquo;t <em>promise</em> to write to them. I
don&rsquo;t believe they ever get any letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children had a great deal of affection and some secret pity
for these playfellows of theirs, who had a sick mother, and who did
not get half the pleasures and amusements that they did. And, as I
have already told you, they could not bear Miss Chesterton, the
little boys&rsquo; aunt, who lived with them. They felt sure that
Jacky and Francis must be unhappy, only because they had to live
with Miss Chesterton.</p>
<p>This was Milly&rsquo;s letter when it was done. Milly could only
write very slowly, in rather big hand, so that her letters were
never very long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">My Dear
Jacky</span>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you think it very odd getting a
letter from me? It is nearly a fortnight since we came here. At
first it was <em>very</em> nice. We went up the mountains, and Aunt
Emma took us in a boat on the lake. And we gathered some wild
strawberries, only some of them were quite white&mdash;not red a
bit. But now it has begun to rain, and we don&rsquo;t like it at
all. Perhaps we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to get home because the
rain will cover up the roads. It is <em>very</em> dull staying in,
only mother makes us such nice plays. Good-bye, Jacky. I send my
love to Francis. Mind you don&rsquo;t forget us.</p>
<p>Your loving little friend,<br />
MILLY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olly wrote a much longer letter, that is to say, mother wrote
for him, and he told her what to say, and as this was a much easier
way of writing than Milly&rsquo;s way, he got on very fast, and
Mrs. Norton had to write as quickly as she could, to keep up with
him. And this was what Olly had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">My Dear
Francis</span>&mdash;I wonder what you&rsquo;ll say to-morrow
morning when the postman brings you this letter. I hope
you&rsquo;ll write back, because it won&rsquo;t be fair if you
don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t such fun here now because it does rain
so. Milly and I are always telling the rain to go away, but it
won&rsquo;t&mdash;though it did at home. Last week we went out in a
boat, and I rowed. I rowed a great way, much farther than Milly. We
went very slow when Milly rowed. It was very jolly at the picnic.
Aunt Emma gave me some cake, and mother gave me some bread and jam.
Nana won&rsquo;t let us have cake and jam both, when we have tea at
home. Aunt Emma told us a story about King Arthur. I don&rsquo;t
believe you ever heard it. The water-fairies took him away, and his
friend wanted to go too, but the king said &lsquo;No! you must stop
behind.&rsquo; Milly cried because she felt sad about the king. I
didn&rsquo;t cry, because I&rsquo;m a little boy. Mother says you
won&rsquo;t understand about the story, and she says we must tell
it you when we get home. So we will, only perhaps we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t remember. Do you do lessons now? We don&rsquo;t
do any&mdash;only when it rains. Milly&rsquo;s writing a letter to
Jacky&mdash;mine&rsquo;s much longer than hers.</p>
<p>Your little friend,<br />
OLLY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came the putting up the letters, addressing them, and
stamping them, all of which the children enjoyed very much, and by
the time they were laid on the hall table ready to go to the post
it was nearly dinner-time.</p>
<p>How the beck did roar that afternoon. And when the children
looked out from the drawing-room window they could see a little
flood on the lawn, where the water had come over the side of the
stream. While they were having their tea, with mother sitting by,
working and chattering to them, they heard a knock at the door, and
when they opened it there was father standing in the unused
kitchen, with the water running off his waterproof coat, making
little streams all over the stone floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been down to look at the river,&rdquo; he said to
Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;Keep off, children! I&rsquo;m much too wet to
touch. Such rain! It does know how to come down here! The
water&rsquo;s over the road just by the stepping-stones. John
Backhouse says if it goes on another twenty-four hours like this,
there&rsquo;ll be no getting to Wanwick by the road, on
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Milly, looking at him with a very
solemn face, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be dreadful if it went on
raining and raining, and if the river came up and up, right up to
the drive and into the hall, and we all had to sit upstairs, and
the butcher couldn&rsquo;t bring us any meat, and John Backhouse
couldn&rsquo;t bring us any milk, and we all <em>died</em> of
hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they would put us into some black boxes,&rdquo; said
Olly, cheerfully, with his mouth full of bread and butter,
&ldquo;and they would put the black boxes into some boats, and take
us right away and bury us krick&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t they,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, who had by this
time got rid of his wet coat, and was seated by Milly, helping
himself to some tea, &ldquo;suppose we got into the boats before we
were dead, and rowed away to Windermere station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! father,&rdquo; said Milly, who always liked her
stories to be as gloomy as possible, &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t
know anything about us till we were dead you know, and then
they&rsquo;d come and find us, and be <em>very</em> sorry for us,
and say, &lsquo;Oh dear! oh dear! what a pity!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly began to look so dismal as Milly&rsquo;s fancies grew more
and more melancholy, that Mrs. Norton took to laughing at them all.
What did they know about Westmoreland rain indeed. This was
nothing&mdash;just nothing at all; she <em>could</em> remember some
floods in the wintertime, when she was a little girl, and used to
stay with Aunt Emma and great-grandmamma; but as for this, why, it
was a good summer wetting, and that was all.</p>
<p>A romp sent the children to bed in excellent spirits again. This
time both Milly and Olly stood at the window together, and told the
rain to be sure to go to Spain that night, and never come back
again while they were at Ravensnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you might go to Willingham, you know, dear Mr.
Rain,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;I daresay mother&rsquo;s flowers
want a good watering. And there&rsquo;s Spot&mdash;you might give
her a good washing&mdash;she <em>can</em> wash herself, but she
won&rsquo;t. Only we don&rsquo;t want you here, Mr.
Rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what an obstinate disagreeable Mr. Rain it was! All that
night it went on pouring, till the little beck in the garden was so
full it was almost choked, and could only get along by sputtering
and foaming as if some wicked water-fairies were driving it along
and tormenting it. And all the little pools on the mountain, the
&ldquo;tarns,&rdquo; as Becky and Tiza called them, filled up, and
the rain made the mountain itself so wet that it was like one big
bog all over.</p>
<p>When the children woke up the flood on the lawn was growing
bigger, and it seemed to them as if the house and garden were all
wrapped up in a wet white cloud-blanket. They could not see the
mountain at all from the window, it was all covered with a thick
white mist, and the dark fir trees in the garden looked sad and
drooping, as if the weight of raindrops was too much for them to
carry.</p>
<p>The children had made up their minds so completely the night
before that it <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> rain more than two days
running, that they felt as if they could hardly be expected to bear
this third wet morning cheerfully. Nurse found them cross and out
of spirits at breakfast. Even a prospect of asking Becky and Tiza
to tea did not bring any smiles to their forlorn little faces. It
would be no fun having anybody to tea. They couldn&rsquo;t go out,
and there was nothing amusing indoors.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Olly set to work to get into mischief, as he
generally did when he felt dull. Nurse discovered him smearing
Katie&rsquo;s cheeks with raspberry jam &ldquo;to make them get red
kricker&rdquo; as he said, and alas! some of the jam had stuck to
the new silk frock, and spoilt all its smart fresh look.</p>
<p>When Milly found it out she began to cry, and when Mrs. Norton
came in she saw a heap on the floor, which was Milly, sobbing,
while Olly sat beside her with his mouth wide open, as if he was a
good deal astonished at the result of his first attempt at
doctoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up the pieces, old woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton,
taking hold of the heap and lifting it up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with you both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olly&rsquo;s spoilt my doll,&rdquo; sobbed Milly,
&ldquo;and it <em>will</em> go on raining&mdash;and I feel
so&mdash;so&mdash;dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t spoil her doll, mother,&rdquo; cried Olly,
eagerly. &ldquo;I only rubbed some jam on its cheeks to make them a
nicey pink&mdash;only some of it <em>would</em> sticky her
dress&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like some jam rubbed on your cheeks,
sir?&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, who could scarcely help laughing at
poor Katie&rsquo;s appearance when nurse handed the doll to her.
&ldquo;Suppose you leave Milly&rsquo;s dolls alone for the future;
but cheer up, Milly! I think I can make Katie very nearly right
again. Come upstairs to my room and we&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good deal of sponging and rubbing, and careful drying by
the kitchen fire, Katie came very nearly right again, and then Mrs.
Norton tried whether some lessons would drive the rain out of the
children&rsquo;s heads. But the lessons did not go well. It was all
Milly could do to help crying every time she got a figure wrong in
her sum, and Olly took about ten minutes to read two lines of his
reading-book. Olly had just begun his sums, and Milly was standing
up to say some poetry to her mother, looking a woebegone little
figure, with pale cheeks and heavy eyes, when suddenly there was a
noise of wheels outside, and both the children turned to look out
of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A carriage! a carriage!&rdquo; shouted Olly, jumping
down, and running to the window.</p>
<p>There, indeed, was one of the shut-up &ldquo;cars,&rdquo; as the
Westmoreland people call them, coming up the Ravensnest drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, starting
up, &ldquo;how good of her to come over on such a day. Run,
children, and open the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down flew Milly and Olly, tumbling over one another in their
hurry; but father had already thrown the door open, and who should
they see stepping down the carriage-steps but Aunt Emma herself,
with her soft gray hair shining under her veil, and her dear kind
face as gentle and cheery as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma! Aunt Emma!&rdquo; shouted Olly, dancing up to
her, and throwing his arms round her, &ldquo;<em>are</em> you come
to tell us about old Mother Quiverquake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gipsy, don&rsquo;t strangle me! Well, Lucy dear, here
I am. Will you have me to dinner? I thought we&rsquo;d all be
company for each other this bad day. Why, Milly, what have you been
doing to your cheeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been crying,&rdquo; said Olly, in spite of
Milly&rsquo;s pulling him by the sleeve to be quiet, &ldquo;because
I stickened her doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and quite right too. Dolls weren&rsquo;t made to be
stickied. But now, who&rsquo;s going to carry my bag upstairs? Take
it gently, Milly, it&rsquo;s got my cap inside, and if you crumple
my cap I shall have to sit with my head in a bandbox at dinner. Old
ladies are <em>never</em> seen without their caps you know. The
most dreadful things would happen if they were! Olly, you may put
my umbrella away. There now, I&rsquo;ll go to mother&rsquo;s room
and take off my things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter7" name="Chapter7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
<h3>A Story-Telling Game</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When Aunt Emma was safely settled, cap and all, in one of the
drawing-room arm-chairs, it seemed to the children as if the rain
and the gray sky did not matter nearly so much as they had done
half an hour before. In the first place, her coming made something
new and interesting to think about; and in the second place, they
felt quite sure that Aunt Emma hadn&rsquo;t brought her little
black bag into the drawing-room with her for nothing. If only her
cap had been in it, why of course she would have left it in
mother&rsquo;s bedroom. But here it was in her lap, with her two
hands folded tight over it, as if it contained something precious!
How very puzzling and interesting!</p>
<p>However, for a long time it seemed as if Aunt Emma had nothing
at all to say about her bag. She began to tell them about her
drive&mdash;how in two places the horse had to go splashing through
the water, and how once, when they were crossing a little river
that ran across the road, the water came so far up the wheels that
&ldquo;I put my head out of the window,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma,
&ldquo;and said to my old coachman, &lsquo;Now, John, if it&rsquo;s
going to get any deeper than this, you&rsquo;d better turn him
round and go home, for I&rsquo;m an old woman, not a fish, and I
can&rsquo;t swim. Of course, if the horse can swim with the
carriage behind him it&rsquo;s all right, but I have my
doubts.&rsquo; Now John, my dears, has been with me a great many
years, and he knows very well that I&rsquo;m rather a nervous old
woman. It&rsquo;s very sad, but it is so. Don&rsquo;t you be
nervous when you&rsquo;re old people. So all he said was &lsquo;All
right, ma&rsquo;am. Bless you, he can swim like a trout.&rsquo; And
crack went the whip, splash went the water! It seemed to me it was
just going to come in under the door, when, lo and behold! there we
were safe and sound on dry ground again. But whether my old horse
swam through or walked through I can&rsquo;t tell you. I like to
believe he swam, because I&rsquo;m so fond of him, and one likes to
believe the creatures one loves can do clever things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask John when he comes to take you away, Aunt
Emma,&rdquo; said Olly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe horses can
swim when they&rsquo;re in a carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a matter-of-fact monkey,&rdquo; said Aunt
Emma. &ldquo;Dear me, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a loud squeak had suddenly startled the children, who were
now looking about them everywhere in vain, to find out where it
came from. Squeak! again. This time the voice certainly came from
near Aunt Emma&rsquo;s chair, but there was nothing to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange house you live in,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma,
with a perfectly grave face. &ldquo;You must have caught a magician
somehow. That&rsquo;s a magician&rsquo;s squeak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again came the noise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; shouted Olly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Aunt Emma&rsquo;s bag! I&rsquo;m sure it came out of the
bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bag!&rdquo;&mdash;holding it up and looking at it.
&ldquo;Now does it look like a bag that squeaks? It&rsquo;s a
perfectly well-behaved bag, and never did such a thing in its
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Olly, dancing round her in
great excitement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the parrot in
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma. &ldquo;This is really
serious. If you think I am such a cruel old woman as to shut up a
poor poll-parrot in a bag, there&rsquo;s no help for it, we must
open the bag. But it&rsquo;s a very curious bag&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t stand too near it if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Click! went the fastening of the bag, and out jumped&mdash;what
do you think? Why, the very biggest frog that was ever seen, in
this part of the world at any rate, a green speckled frog, that
hopped on to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s knee, and then on to the floor,
where it went hopping and squeaking along the carpet, till all of a
sudden, when it got to the door, it turned over on its back, and
lay there quite quiet with its legs in the air.</p>
<p>The children followed it with looks half of horror, half of
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Aunt Emma? Is it alive?&rdquo; asked Milly,
jumping on to a chair as the frog came near her, and drawing her
little skirts tight round her legs, while Olly went cautiously
after it, with his hands on his knees, one step at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask it,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, who had
at last begun to laugh a little, as if it was impossible to keep
grave any longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it looks very peaceable
just now, poor thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the children crept up to it, and examined it closely. Yes, it
was a green speckled frog, but what it was made of, and whether it
was alive, and if it was not alive how it managed to hop and
squeak&mdash;these were the puzzles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take hold of it, Milly,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, who had
just come up from his work, and was standing laughing near the
door. &ldquo;Turn it over on its legs again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll turn it,&rdquo; cried Olly, making a dash,
and turning it over in a great hurry, keeping his legs and feet
well out of the way. Hop! squeak! there it was off again, right
down the room with the children after it, till it suddenly came up
against a table leg, and once more turned over on its back and lay
quite still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Emma, is it a toy?&rdquo; asked Milly, who now
felt brave enough to take it up and look at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, I believe so&mdash;a very lively one. Bring
it here, and I&rsquo;ll tell you something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the children brought it very cautiously, as if they were not
quite sure what it would do next, and then Aunt Emma explained to
them that she had once paid a visit to a shop in London where
Japanese toys&mdash;toys made in the country of Japan&mdash;far
away on the other side of the world&mdash;were sold, and that there
she found master froggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there never was such a toy as froggy for a wet
day,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma. &ldquo;I have tried him on all sorts of
boys and girls, and he never fails. He&rsquo;s as good a cure for a
cross face as a poultice is for a sore finger. But, Milly, listen!
I declare there&rsquo;s something else going on in my bag. I really
think, my dear bag, you might be quiet now that you have got rid of
froggy! What can all this chattering be about? Sh! sh!&rdquo; and
Aunt Emma held up her finger at the children, while she held the
bag up to her ear, and listened carefully. Olly was almost beside
himself with excitement, but Milly had got his little brown hands
tight in hers for fear he should make a jump at the bag.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I
thought. The bag declares it&rsquo;s not his fault at all, but that
if I will give him such noisy creatures to carry I must take the
consequences. He says there&rsquo;s a whole family now inside him,
making such a noise he can hardly hear himself speak. It&rsquo;s
enough, he says, to drive a respectable bag mad, and he must blow
up if it goes on. Dear me! I must look into this. Milly, come
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly came near, and Aunt Emma opened the bag solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Milly, I&rsquo;ll hold it for fear it should take it
into its poor head to blow up, and you put your hand in and see
what you can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Milly put her hand in, feeling a good deal excited as to what
might happen&mdash;and what do you think she brought out? A whole
handful of the most delicious dolls:&mdash;cardboard dolls of all
sorts and kinds, like those in mother&rsquo;s drawer at home; paper
dolls, mamma dolls, little boy dolls and little girl dolls, baby
dolls and nurse dolls; dolls in suits and dolls in frocks; dolls in
hats and dolls in nightgowns; a papa in trousers and a mamma in a
magnificent blue dress with flounces and a train; a nurse in white
cap and apron and the most bewitching baby doll you ever saw, with
a frilled paper cap that slipped on and off, and a white frock with
pink ribbons. And the best of these dolls was, that each of them
had a piece of cardboard fastened on behind and a little bit of
cardboard to stand on, so that when you spread out the piece behind
they stood up as naturally as possible, and looked as if they were
going to talk to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Emma, dear Aunt Emma!&rdquo; cried Milly, beside
herself with delight as she spread them all out in her lap.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just like mother&rsquo;s at home,
mother&rsquo;s that you made for her when she was a little
girl&mdash;only ever so many more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, I made mother&rsquo;s for her long ago, when
it rained for days and days without stopping, and she had grown
tired of pretty nearly everything and everybody indoors; and now I
have been spending part of these rainy days in making a new set for
mother&rsquo;s little girl. There, dear little woman, I think you
must have given me a kiss for each of them by this time. Suppose
you try and make them stand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Olly, who was busy examining
the mysterious bag&mdash;how could the dolls talk? they&rsquo;re
only paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; answered Aunt Emma,
rescuing the bag, and putting it safely under her chair. &ldquo;You
<em>might</em> ask the bag&mdash;but it wouldn&rsquo;t answer you.
Magical bags never do talk except to their masters or
mistresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Olly had to puzzle it out for himself while he played with
the Japanese frog. That was an extraordinary frog! You should have
seen nurse&rsquo;s start when Olly hid himself in the passage and
sent the frog hopping and squeaking through the open door of the
night nursery, where nurse was sitting sewing; and as for cook,
when the creature came flopping over her kitchen floor she very
nearly spoilt the hash she was making for dinner by dropping a
whole pepper-box into the middle of it! There was no end to the fun
to be got out of froggy, and Olly amused himself with it the whole
of the morning, while Milly went through long stories with her
dolls upstairs, helped every now and then by Aunt Emma, who sat
knitting and talking to mother.</p>
<p>At dinner the children had to sit quiet while Mr. and Mrs.
Norton and Aunt Emma talked. Father and mother had been almost as
much cheered up by Aunt Emma&rsquo;s coming as the children
themselves, and now the dinner-table was lively with pleasant talk;
talk about books, and talk about pictures, and talk about foreign
places, and talk about the mountains and the people living near
Ravensnest, many of whom mother had known when she was a little
girl. Milly, who was old enough to listen, could only understand a
little bit here and there; but there was always Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
friendly gentle face to look at, and her soft old hand in its black
mitten, to slip her own little fingers into; while Olly was so
taken up with the prospects of the black-currant pudding which he
had seen cook making in the morning, and the delight of it when it
came, that it seemed no trouble to him to sit still.</p>
<p>As for the rain, there was not much difference. Perhaps there
were a few breaks in the clouds, and it might be beating a little
less heavily on the glass conservatory outside the dining-room,
still, on the whole, the weather was much the same as it had been.
It was wonderful to see how little notice the children had taken of
it since Aunt Emma came, and when they escorted her upstairs after
dinner, they quite forgot to rush to the window and look out, as
they had been doing the last three days at every possible
opportunity.</p>
<p>The children got her safe into a chair, and then Olly brought a
stool to one side of her, and Milly brought a stool to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Now,</em> can you remember about old Mother
Quiverquake?&rdquo; said Olly, resting his little sunburnt chin on
Aunt Emma&rsquo;s knee, and looking up to her with eager eyes.</p>

width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose we have a story-telling
game&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I daresay I shall begin to remember about her
presently; but suppose, children, we have a <em>story-telling
game</em>. We&rsquo;ll tell stories&mdash;you and Olly, father,
mother, and everybody. That&rsquo;s much fairer than that one
person should do all the telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Milly, shaking her head
gravely, &ldquo;we are only little children. Little children
can&rsquo;t make up stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose little children try,&rdquo; said mother. &ldquo;I
think Aunt Emma&rsquo;s is an excellent plan. Now, father,
you&rsquo;ll have to tell one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s lazy,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, coming out
from behind his newspaper. &ldquo;But, perhaps, if you all of you
tell very exciting stories you may stir him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; cried Olly, who had a vivid
remembrance of his father&rsquo;s stories, though they only came
very seldom, &ldquo;tell us about the rat with three tails, and the
dog that walked on its nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, &ldquo;those
won&rsquo;t do for such a grand story-telling as this. I must think
of some story which is all long words and good children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t</em> father,&rdquo; said Milly,
imploringly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ever so much nicer when they get
into scrapes, you know, and tumble down, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to begin?&rdquo; said Aunt Emma. &ldquo;I
think mother had better begin. Afterwards it will be your turn,
Olly; then father, then Milly, and then me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve got a scrap of a story
in my head,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s weeks since
I caught one last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look here, Olly,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. Go up gently behind mother,
and kiss her three times on the top of the head. That&rsquo;s the
way to send the stories in. Mother will soon begin to feel one
fidgeting inside her head after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Olly went gently up behind his mother, climbed on a stool at
the back of her chair, and kissed her softly three times at the
back of her head. Mrs. Norton lay still for a few moments after the
kisses, with closed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Now I think
I&rsquo;ve caught one. But it&rsquo;s a very little one, poor
little thing. And yet, strange to say, though it&rsquo;s very
little, it&rsquo;s very old. Now, children, you must be kind to my
story. I caught him first a great many years ago in an old book,
but I am afraid you will hardly care for him as much as I did.
Well, once upon a time there was a great king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it King Arthur, mother?&rdquo; interrupted Olly,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! this king lived in a different country altogether.
He lived in a beautiful hot country over the sea, called
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! a <em>hot</em> country!&rdquo; protested
Milly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the rain goes to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, I don&rsquo;t think you know any more about
it, except that you <em>tell</em> the rain to go there. Don&rsquo;t
you know by this time that the rain never does what it&rsquo;s
told? Really, very little rain goes to Spain, and in some parts of
the country the people would be very glad indeed if we could send
them some of the rain we don&rsquo;t want at Ravensnest. But now,
you mustn&rsquo;t interrupt me, or I shall forget my
story&mdash;Well there was once a king who lived in a <em>very</em>
hot part of Spain, where they don&rsquo;t have much rain, and where
it hardly ever snows or freezes. And this king had a beautiful
wife, whom he loved very much. But, unluckily, this beautiful wife
had one great fault. She was always wishing for the most
unreasonable and impossible things, and though the king was always
trying to get her what she wanted she was never satisfied, and
every day she seemed to grow more and more discontented and
exacting. At last, one day in the winter, a most extraordinary
thing happened. A shower of snow fell in Cordova, which was the
name of the town where the king and queen lived, and it whitened
the hills all around the town, so that they looked as if somebody
had been dusting white sugar over them. Now snow was hardly ever
seen in Cordova, and the people in the town wondered at it, and
talked about it a great deal. But after she had looked at it a
little-while the queen began to cry bitterly. None of her ladies
could comfort her, nor would she tell any of them what was the
matter. There she sat at her window, weeping, till the king came to
see her. When he came he could not imagine what she was crying
about, and begged her to tell him why. &lsquo;I am weeping,&rsquo;
she said, sobbing all the time, &lsquo;because the hills&mdash;are
not always&mdash;covered with snow. See how pretty they look! And
yet&mdash;I have never, till now, seen them look like that. If you
really loved me, you would manage some way or other that it should
snow once a year at any rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how can I make it snow?&rsquo; cried the king
in great trouble, because she would go on weeping and weeping, and
spoiling her pretty eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the
queen, crossly, &lsquo;but you can&rsquo;t love me a bit, or
you&rsquo;d certainly try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the king thought and thought, and at last he hit
upon a beautiful plan. He sent into all parts of Spain to buy
almond trees, and planted them on the hills all round the town. Now
the almond tree, as you know, has a lovely pinky-white blossom, so
when the next spring arrived all these thousands of almond trees
came out into bloom all over the hills round Cordova, so that they
looked at a distance as if they were covered with white snow. And
for once the queen was delighted, and could not help saying a nice
&lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; to the king for all the trouble he had
taken to please her. But it was not very long before she grew
discontented again, and began once more to wish for all kinds of
ridiculous things. One day she was sitting at her window, and she
saw some ragged little children playing by the river that ran round
the palace. They were dabbling in the mud at the side, sticking
their little bare feet into it, or scooping up pieces which they
rolled into balls and threw at one another. The queen watched them
for some time, and at last she began to weep bitterly. One of her
maidens ran and told the king that the queen was weeping, and he
came in a great hurry to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just look at those children down there!&rsquo;
said the queen, sobbing and pointing to them. &lsquo;Did you ever
see anybody so happy? Why can&rsquo;t I have mud to dabble in too,
and why can&rsquo;t I take off my shoes and stockings, and amuse
myself like the children do, instead of being so dull and stuck-up
all day long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because it isn&rsquo;t proper for queens to dabble
in the mud,&rsquo; said the poor king in great perplexity, for he
didn&rsquo;t at all like the idea of his beautiful queen dabbling
in the mud with the little ragged children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just like you,&rsquo; said the queen,
beginning to cry faster than ever,&rsquo; you never do anything to
please me. What&rsquo;s the good of being proper? What&rsquo;s the
good of being a queen at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This made the king very unhappy, and again he thought and
thought, till at last he hit upon a plan. He ordered a very large
shallow bath of white marble to be made in the palace-garden. Then
he poured into it all kinds of precious stones, and chips of
sweet-smelling wood, besides a thousand cartloads of rose-leaves
and a thousand cartloads of orange flowers. All these he ordered to
be stirred up together with a great ivory spoon, till they made a
kind of wonderful mud, and then he had the bath filled up with
scented water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; he said to the queen, when he had
brought her down to look at it, &lsquo;you may take off your shoes
and stockings and paddle about in this mud as much as you
like.&rsquo; You may imagine that this was a very pleasant kind of
mud to dabble in, and the queen and her ladies amused themselves
with it immensely for some time. But nothing could keep this
tiresome queen amused for long together, and in about a fortnight
she had grown quite tired of her wonderful bath. It seemed as if
the king&rsquo;s pains had been all thrown away. She grew cross and
discontented again, and her ladies began to say to each other,
&lsquo;What will she wish for next, I wonder? The king might as
well try to drink up the sea as try to get her all she
wants.&rsquo; At last, one day, when she and her ladies were
walking near the palace, they met a shepherdess driving a flock of
sheep up into the hills. The shepherdess looked so pretty and
bright in her red petticoat and tall yellow cap, that the queen
stopped to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are you going, pretty maiden, with your
woolly white sheep?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am going up to the hills,&rsquo; said the
shepherdess. &lsquo;Now the sun has scorched up the fields down
below we must take our sheep up to the cool hills, where the grass
is still fresh and green. Good-day, good-day, the sheep are going
so fast I cannot wait.&rsquo; So on she tripped, singing and
calling to her sheep, who came every now and then to rub their soft
coats against her, as if they loved her. The queen looked after
her, and her face began to pucker up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why am I not a shepherdess?&rsquo; she exclaimed,
bursting into tears. &lsquo;I <em>hate</em> being a queen! I never
sang as merrily as that little maiden in all my life. I must and
will be a shepherdess, and drive sheep up into the mountain, or I
shall die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all that night the foolish queen sat at her window
crying, and when the morning came she had made herself look quite
old and ugly. When the king came to see her he was dreadfully
troubled, and begged her to tell him what was the matter now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to be a shepherdess, and drive sheep up
into the mountains,&rsquo; sobbed the queen. &lsquo;Why should the
little shepherdess girls look always so happy and merry, while I am
dying of dulness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king thought it was very unkind of her to say she was
dying of dulness when he had taken so much trouble to get her all
she wanted; but he knew it was no good talking to her while she was
in such a temper. So all he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How can I turn you into a shepherdess? These
shepherdesses stay out all night with their sheep on the hills, and
live on water and a crust of bread. How would you like
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I-should like it,&rsquo; said the queen,
&lsquo;anything for a change. Besides, nothing could be nicer than
staying out of doors these lovely nights. And as for food, you know
very well that I am never hungry here, and that it doesn&rsquo;t
matter in the least to me what I eat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;you shall go up
to the hills, if you promise to take your ladies with you, and if
you will let me send a tent to shelter you at night, and some
servants to look after you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As if that would give me any pleasure!&rsquo; said
the queen, &lsquo;to be followed about and waited upon is just what
I detest. I will go alone; just like that pretty little
shepherdess, if I go at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the king declared that nothing would induce him to
let her go alone. So the queen set to work to cry, and she cried
for two days and two nights without stopping, and at the end of
that time the poor king was ready to let her go anywhere or do
anything for the sake of a little peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she had her own way. They found her a flock of the
loveliest white sheep, all with blue ribbons round their necks, and
blue rosettes on their little white tails; and the queen dressed
herself up in a red silk petticoat and a cap embroidered in gold
and silver, and then she set out by herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first it was all delightful. She drove the sheep up
the soft green hillsides, and laughed with delight to see them
nibbling the fresh grass, and running hither and thither after her,
and after each other. The evening sun shone brightly, and she sat
herself down on a rock and sang all the tunes she knew, that she
might be just like the little shepherdess. But while she was
singing the sheep strayed away, and she had to run after them as
fast as she could, to catch them up. This made her hot and tired,
so she tried to make them lie down under a chestnut tree, that she
might rest beside them. But the sheep were not a bit tired, and had
no mind to rest at all. While she was calling one set of them
together the other set ran scampering off, and the queen found out
that she must just give up her way for once and follow theirs. On
went the sheep, up hill and down dale, nibbling and frisking and
trotting to their hearts&rsquo; content, till the queen was worn
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, by the time the sun was setting, the poor queen
was so tired that she could walk no longer. Down she sat, and the
ungrateful sheep kicked up their little hind legs and trotted away
out of sight as fast as they could trot. There she was left on the
hillside all alone. It began to get dark, and the sky, instead of
being blue and clear as it had been, filled with black clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rsquo; sighed the queen,
&lsquo;here is a storm coming. If I could only find my way down the
hill, if I could only see the town!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there were trees all about her, which hid the view,
and soon it was so dark there was nothing to be seen, not even the
stars. And presently, crash came the thunder, and after the thunder
the rain&mdash;such rain! It soaked the queen&rsquo;s golden cap
till it was so heavy with water she was obliged to throw it away,
and her silk petticoat was as wet as if she had been taking a bath
in it. In vain she ran hither and thither, trying to find a way
through the trees, while the rain blinded her, and the thunder
deafened her, till at last she was forced to sink down on the
ground, feeling more wretched and frightened and cold than any
queen ever felt before. Oh, if she were only safe back in her
beautiful palace! If only she had the tent the king wanted to send
with her! But there all night she had to stay, and all night the
storm went on, till the queen was lying in a flood, and the owls
and bats, startled out of their holes, went flying past her in the
dark, and frightening her out of her senses. When the morning came
there was such a shivering, crumpled up queen sitting on the grass,
that even her own ladies would scarcely have known her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, husband! husband!&rsquo; she cried, getting up
and wringing her cold little hands. &lsquo;You will never find me,
and your poor wicked wife will die of cold and hunger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tirra-lirra! tirra-lirra! What was that sounding in the
forest? Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;it was a hunting horn. But who
could be blowing it so early in the cold gray morning, when it was
scarcely light? On ran the queen toward where the sound came from.
Over rocks and grass she ran, till, all of a sudden, stepping out
from behind a tree, came the king himself, who had been looking for
her for hours. And then what do you think the discontented queen
did? She folded her hands, and hung her head, and said, quite sadly
and simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my lord king, make me a shepherdess really. I
don&rsquo;t deserve to be a queen. Send me away, and let me knit
and spin for my living. I have plagued you long enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suddenly it seemed to the king as if there had been a
black speck in the queen&rsquo;s heart, which had been all washed
away by the rain; and he took her hands, and led her home to the
palace in joy and gladness. And so they lived happy ever
afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you <em>very</em> much, mother,&rdquo; said Milly,
stretching up her arms and drawing down Mrs. Norton&rsquo;s face to
kiss her. &ldquo;Do you really think the queen was never
discontented any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you any more than the story
does,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;You see there would always be
that dreadful night to think about, if she ever felt inclined to
be; but I daresay the queen didn&rsquo;t find it very easy at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have made her be a shepherdess,&rdquo; said Olly,
shaking his head gravely. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t nice, not a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Mr. Severity!&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, pulling his
brown curls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn next, Olly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Milly must kiss me first,&rdquo; said Olly, looking
rather scared, as if something he didn&rsquo;t quite understand was
going to happen to him.</p>
<p>So Milly went through the operation of kissing him three times
on the back of the head, and then Olly&rsquo;s eyes, finding it did
no good to stare at Aunt Emma or mother, went wandering all round
the room in search of something else to help him. Suddenly they
came to the window, where a brown speck was dancing up and down,
and then Olly&rsquo;s face brightened, and he began in a great
hurry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a
daddy-long-legs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Milly, when they had waited a little
while, and nothing more came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more,&rdquo; said Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that <em>is</em> silly,&rdquo; said Milly,
&ldquo;why, that isn&rsquo;t a story at all. Shut your eyes tight,
that&rsquo;s much the best way of making a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Olly shut his eyes, and pressed his two hands tightly over
them, and then he began again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a
daddy-long-legs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a <em>good</em> daddy-long-legs?&rdquo; asked
Milly, anxious to help him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Olly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it, Milly.
Once upon a time there was a good daddy-long-legs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he do?&rdquo; asked Milly,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;flewed on to father&rsquo;s
nose!&rdquo; said Olly, keeping his hands tight over his eyes,
while his little white teeth appeared below in a broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And father said, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that on my
nose?&rsquo; and the daddy-long-legs said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me,
don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; And father said, &lsquo;Get away off
my nose, I don&rsquo;t like you a bit.&rsquo; And the
daddy-long-legs said, &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t go away. It&rsquo;s hot
on the window, the sun gets in my eyes. I like sitting up here
best.&rsquo; So father took a big sofa-cushion and gave his nose
<em>ever</em> such a bang! And the daddy-long-legs tumbled down
dead. And the cushion tumbled down dead. And father tumbled down
dead. And that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Olly opening his eyes, and
looking extremely proud of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly boy!&rdquo; cried Milly, &ldquo;that
isn&rsquo;t a bit like a real story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Aunt Emma and father and mother laughed a good deal at
Olly&rsquo;s story, and Aunt Emma said it would do very well for
such a small boy.</p>
<p>Whose turn was it next?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s turn! father&rsquo;s turn!&rdquo; cried
the children, in great glee, looking round for him; but while
Olly&rsquo;s story had been going on, Mr. Norton, who was sitting
behind them in a big arm-chair, had been covering himself up with
sofa cushions and newspapers, till there was only the tip of one of
his boots to be seen, coming out from under the heap. The children
were a long time dragging him out, for he pelted them with
cushions, and crumpled the newspapers over their heads, till they
were so tired with laughing and struggling they had no strength
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, it isn&rsquo;t fair, I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo;
said Milly at last, sitting a breathless heap on the floor.
&ldquo;Of course little people can&rsquo;t <em>make</em> big people
do things, so the big people ought to do them without
making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not at all good reasoning, Milly,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, who could not resist the temptation of throwing
one more sofa cushion at her laughing face. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
<em>make</em> nurse stand on her head, but that&rsquo;s no reason
why nurse should stand on her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Olly, moving up a stool behind his father&rsquo;s
chair, brought his little mouth suddenly down on his father&rsquo;s
head, and gave him three kisses in a great hurry, with a shout of
triumph at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, shutting his eyes and
falling back as if something had happened to him. &ldquo;This is
very serious. Aunt Emma, that spell of yours is really <em>too</em>
strong. My poor head! It will certainly burst if I don&rsquo;t get
this story out directly! Come, jump up,
children&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up jumped the children, one on each knee, and Mr. Norton began
at once.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter8" name="Chapter8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<h3>The Story of Beowulf</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a great&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; interrupted Milly, &ldquo;I shall soon be
getting tired of &lsquo;Once upon a time there was a great
king.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry till you&rsquo;re hurt, Milly; which
means, wait till I get to the end of my sentence. Well, once upon a
time there was a great&mdash;hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a hero?&rdquo; asked Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Milly, eagerly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
brave man that&rsquo;s always fighting and killing giants and
dragons and cruel people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do to begin with,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton,
&ldquo;though, when you grow older, you will find that people can
be heroes without fighting or killing. However, the man I am going
to tell you about was just the kind of hero you&rsquo;re thinking
of, Milly. He loved fighting with giants and dragons and wild
people, and my story is going to be about two of his
fights&mdash;the greatest he ever fought. The name of this hero was
Beowulf, and he lived in a country called Sweden (Milly knows all
about Sweden, Olly, and you must get her to show it you on the
map), with a number of other brave men who were his friends, and
helped him in his battles. And one day a messenger came over the
sea from another country close by, called Denmark, and the
messenger said, &lsquo;Which of all you brave men will come over
and help my master, King Hrothgar, who is in sore trouble?&rsquo;
And the messenger told them how Hrothgar, for many years past, had
been plagued by a monster&mdash;the hateful monster
Grendel&mdash;half a man and half a beast, who lived at the bottom
of a great bog near the king&rsquo;s palace. Every night, he said,
Grendel the monster came out of the bog with his horrible mother
beside him&mdash;a wolf-like creature, fearful to look
upon&mdash;and he and she would roam about the country, killing and
slaying all whom they met. Sometimes they would come stalking to
the king&rsquo;s palace, where his brave men were sleeping round
the fire in the big hall, and before anyone could withstand him
Grendel would fall upon the king&rsquo;s warriors, kill them by
tens and twenties, and carry off their dead bodies to his bog. Many
a brave man had tried to slay the monster, but none had been able
so much as to wound him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Beowulf and his friends had heard this story they
thought a while, and then each said to the other, &lsquo;Let us go
across the sea and rid King Hrothgar of this monster.&rsquo; So
they took ship and went across the sea to Hrothgar&rsquo;s country,
and Hrothgar welcomed them royally, and made a great feast in their
honour. And after the feast Hrothgar said to Beowulf, &lsquo;Now, I
give over to you the hall of my palace, that you may guard it
against the monster.&rsquo; So Beowulf and the brave men who had
come over with him made a great fire in the hall, and they all lay
down to sleep beside it. You may imagine that they did not find it
very easy to get to sleep, and some of them thought as they lay
there that very likely they should never see their homes in Sweden
again. But they were tired with journeying and feasting, and one
after another they all fell asleep. Then in the dead of the night,
when all was still, Grendel rose up out of the bog, and came
stalking over the moor to the palace. His eyes flamed with a kind
of horrible light in the darkness, and his steps seemed to shake
the earth; but those inside the palace were sleeping so heavily
that they heard nothing, not even when Grendel burst open the door
of the hall and came in among them. Before anyone had wakened, the
monster had seized one of the sleeping men and torn him to pieces.
Then he came to Beowulf; but Beowulf sprang up out of his sleep and
laid hold upon him boldly. He used no sword to strike him, for
there was no sword which men could make was strong enough to hurt
Grendel; but he seized him with his strong hands, and the two
struggled together in the palace. And they fought till the benches
were torn from the walls, and everything in the hall was smashed
and broken. The brave men, springing up all round, seized their
swords and would gladly have helped their lord, but there was no
one but Beowulf could harm Grendel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they fought, till at last Beowulf tore away
Grendel&rsquo;s hand and arm, and the monster fled away howling
into the darkness. Over the moor he rushed till he came to his bog,
and there he sank down into the middle of the bog, wailing and
shrieking like one whose last hour was come. Then there was great
rejoicing at Heorot, the palace, and King Hrothgar, when he saw
Grendel&rsquo;s hand which Beowulf had torn away, embraced him and
blessed him, and he and all his friends were laden with splendid
gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all was not over yet. When the next night came, and
Hrothgar&rsquo;s men and Beowulf&rsquo;s men were asleep together
in the great hall, Grendel&rsquo;s horrible mother, half a woman
and half a wolf, came rushing to the palace and while they were all
asleep she carried off one of Hrothgar&rsquo;s dearest
friends&mdash;a young noble whom he loved best of all his nobles.
And she killed him, and carried his body back to the bog. Then the
next morning there was grief and weeping in Heorot; but Beowulf
said to the king, &lsquo;Grieve not, O king! till we have found out
Grendel&rsquo;s mother and punished her for her evil deeds. I
promise you she shall give an account for this. She shall not be
able to hide herself in the water, nor under the earth, nor in the
forest, nor at the bottom of the sea; let her go where she will, I
will find a way after her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Beowulf and his friends put on their armour and
mounted their horses, and set out to look for her. And when they
had ridden a long and weary way over steep lonely paths and past
caves where dragons and serpents lived, they came at last to
Grendel&rsquo;s bog&mdash;a fearful place indeed. There in the
middle of it lay a pool of black water, and over the water hung
withered trees, which seemed as if they had been poisoned by the
air rising from the water beneath them. No bird or beast would ever
come near Grendel&rsquo;s pool. If the hounds were hunting a stag,
and they drove him down to the edge, he would sooner let them tear
him to pieces than hide himself in the water. And every night the
black water seemed to burn and flame, and it hissed and bubbled and
groaned as if there were evil creatures tossing underneath. And now
when Beowulf and his men came near it, they saw fierce water
dragons lying near the edge or swimming about the pool. There also,
beside the water, they found the dead body of Hrothgar&rsquo;s
friend, who had been killed by Grendel&rsquo;s mother, and they
took it up, and mourned over him afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Beowulf took an old and splendid sword that Hrothgar
had given him, and he put on his golden helmet and his iron war
shirt that no sword could cut through, and when he had bade his
friends farewell he leapt straight into the middle of the bog. Down
he sank, deeper and deeper into the water, among strange water
beasts that struck at him with their tusks as he passed them, till
at last Grendel&rsquo;s mother, the water-wolf, looked up from the
bottom and saw him coming. Then she sprang upon him, and seized
him, and dragged him down, and he found himself in a sort of hall
under the water, with a pale strange light in it. And then he
turned from the horrible water-wolf and raised his sword and struck
her on the head; but his blow did her no harm. No sword made by
mortal men could harm Grendel or his mother; and as he struck her
Beowulf stumbled and fell. Then the water-wolf rushed forward and
sat upon him as he lay there, and raised aloft her own sharp dagger
to drive it into his breast; but Beowulf shook her off, and sprang
up, and there, on the wall, he saw hanging a strange old sword that
had been made in the old times, long, long ago, when the world was
full of giants. So he threw his own sword aside and took down the
old sword, and once more he smote the water-wolf. And this time his
sword did him good service, and Grendel&rsquo;s fierce mother sank
down dead upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Beowulf looked round him, and he saw lying in a
corner the body of Grendel himself. He cut off the monster&rsquo;s
head, and lo and behold! when he had cut it off the blade of the
old sword melted away, and there was nothing left in his hands but
the hilt, with strange letters on it, telling how it was made in
old days by the giants for a great king. So with that, and
Hrothgar&rsquo;s sword and Grendel&rsquo;s head, Beowulf rose up
again through the bog, and just as his brave men had begun to think
they should never see their dear lord more he came swimming to
land, bearing the great head with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Hrothgar and all his people rejoiced greatly, for
they knew that the land would never more be troubled by these
hateful monsters, but that the ploughers might plough, and the
shepherds might lead their sheep, and brave men might sleep at
night, without fear any more of Grendel and his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; said Milly, breathlessly, when he
stopped. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Olly sat quite still, without speaking, gazing at his father
with wide open brown eyes, and a face as grave and terrified as if
Grendel were actually beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for this time,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton.
&ldquo;Why, Olly, where are your little wits gone to? Did it
frighten you, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Olly, drawing a long breath. &ldquo;I did
think he would never have comed up out of that bog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid,&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;But, father, I
don&rsquo;t understand about that pool. Why didn&rsquo;t Beowulf
get drowned when he went down under the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about
that,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;But heroes in those days,
Milly, must have had something magical about them so that they were
able to do things that men and women can&rsquo;t do now. Do you
know, children, that this story that you have been listening to is
more than a thousand years old? Can you fancy that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Milly, shaking her head. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t fancy it a bit, father. It&rsquo;s too long. It makes
me puzzled to think of so many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years and years and years and <em>years</em>!&rdquo; said
Olly. &ldquo;When father&rsquo;s grandfather was a little
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Norton laughed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think of anything
farther back than that, Olly? It would take a great many
grandfathers, and grandfathers&rsquo; grandfathers, to get back to
the time when the story of Beowulf was made. And here am I telling
it to you just in the same way as fathers used to tell it to their
children a thousand years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the children liked it so, they wouldn&rsquo;t
let their fathers forget it,&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;And then
when they grew up they told it to their children. I shall tell it
to my children when I grow up. I think I shall tell it to Katie
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Olly, &ldquo;did Beowulf
die&mdash;ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. When he was quite an old man he had another great
fight with a dragon, who was guarding a cave full of golden
treasure on the sea-shore; and though he killed the dragon, the
dragon gave him a terrible wound, so that when his friends came to
look for him they found him lying all but dead in the cave. He was
just able to tell them to make a great mound of earth over him when
he was dead, on a high rock close by, that sailors might see it
from their ships and think of him when they saw it, and then he
died. And when he was dead they carried him up to the rock, and
there they burned his body, and then they built up a great high
mound of earth, and they put Beowulf&rsquo;s bones inside, and all
the treasure from the dragon&rsquo;s cave. They were ten days
building up the mound. Then when it was all done they rode around
it weeping and chanting sorrowful songs, and at last they left him
there, saying as they went away that never should they see so good
a king or so true a master any more. And for hundreds of years
afterwards, when the sailors out at sea saw the high mound rising
on its point of rock, they said one to another, &lsquo;There is
Beowulf&rsquo;s Mount,&rsquo; and they began to tell each other of
Beowulf&rsquo;s brave deeds&mdash;how he lived and how he died, and
how he fought with Grendel and the wild sea dragons. There, now, I
have told you all I know about Beowulf,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton,
getting up and turning the children off his knee, &ldquo;and if it
isn&rsquo;t somebody else&rsquo;s turn now it ought to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma! Aunt Emma!&rdquo; shouted Olly, who was so
greedy for stories that he could almost listen all day long without
being tired.</p>
<p>But Aunt Emma only smiled through her spectacles and pointed to
the window. The children ran to look out, and they could hardly
believe their eyes when they saw that it had actually stopped
raining, and that over the tree-tops was a narrow strip of blue
sky, the first they had seen for three whole days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you nice blue sky!&rdquo; exclaimed Milly, dancing up
and down before the window with a beaming face. &ldquo;Mind you
stay there and get bigger. We&rsquo;ll get on our hats presently
and come out to look at you. Oh! there&rsquo;s John Backhouse
coming down the hill with the dogs. Mother, may we go up ourselves
and ask Becky and Tiza to come to tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Aunt Emma must tell us her story first,&rdquo;
persisted Olly, who hated being cheated out of a story by anything
or anybody. &ldquo;She promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly boy!&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;as if I was
going to keep you indoors listening to stories just now, when the
sun&rsquo;s shining for the first time for three whole days. I
promised you my story on a wet day, and you shall have
it&mdash;never fear. There&rsquo;ll be plenty more wet days before
you go away from Ravensnest, I&rsquo;m afraid. There goes my
knitting, and mother&rsquo;s putting away her work, and
father&rsquo;s stretching himself&mdash;which means we&rsquo;re all
going for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fetch Becky and Tiza, mother?&rdquo; asked Milly; and
when mother said &ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; the two children
raced off down the long passage to the nursery in the highest
possible spirits.</p>
<p>Soon they were all walking along the dripping drive past high
banks of wet fern, and under trees which threw down showers of
rain-drops at every puff of wind. And when they got into the road
beside the river the children shouted with glee to see their brown
shallow little river turned into a raging flood of water, which
went sweeping and hurrying through the fields, and every now and
then spreading itself over them and making great pools among the
poor drowned hay. They ran on to look for the stepping-stones, but
to their amazement there was not a stone to be seen. The water was
rushing over them with a great roar and swirl, and Milly shivered a
little bit when she remembered their bathe there a week before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, coming up to
them, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d like, a bathe
to-day&mdash;quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were in there now,&rdquo; said Olly, watching the
river with great excitement, &ldquo;the water would push us down
krick! and the fishes would come and etten us all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be a long time gobbling you up, Master
Fatty,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;Come, run along; it&rsquo;s
too cold to stand about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how brilliant and beautiful it was after the rain! Little
tiny trickling rivers were running down all the roads, and
sparkling in the sun; the wet leaves and grass were glittering, and
the great mountains all around stood up green and fresh against the
blue sky, as if the rain had washed the dust off them from top to
toe, and left them clean and bright. Two things only seemed the
worse for the rain&mdash;the hay and the wild strawberries. Milly
peered into all the banks along the road where she generally found
her favourite little red berries, but most of them were washed
away, and the few miserable things that were left tasted of nothing
but rain water. And as for the hay-fields, they looked so wet and
drenched that it was hard to believe any sunshine could ever dry
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor John Backhouse!&rdquo; said Aunt Emma;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid his hay is a good deal spoilt. Aren&rsquo;t
you glad father&rsquo;s not a farmer, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
always wishing father <em>was</em> a farmer. I want to be like
Becky, and call the cows, and mind the baby all by myself. It must
be nice feeding the chickens, and making the hay, and taking the
milk around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all that&rsquo;s very nice, but how would you like
your hay washed away, and your corn beaten down, and your fruit all
spoilt? Those are things that are constantly happening to John
Backhouse, I expect, in the rainy country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it won&rsquo;t always be summer,&rdquo; said
Milly, considering. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like to
stay in that little weeny house all the winter. Is it very cold
here in the winter, Aunt Emma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very, generally. But last winter was very cold here,
and the snow lay on the ground for weeks and weeks. On Christmas
eve, do you know, Milly, I wanted to have a children&rsquo;s party
in my kitchen, and what do you think I did? The snow was lying deep
on the roads, so I sent out two sledges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are sledges?&rdquo; asked Olly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carriages with the wheels taken off and two long pieces
of wood fastened on instead, so that they slip along smoothly over
the snow. And my old coachman drove one and my gardener the other,
and they went round all the farmhouses near by, and gathered up the
children, little and big, into the sledges, till the coachman had
got eight in his sledge, and the gardener had got nine in his, and
then they came trotting back with the bells round the horses&rsquo;
necks jingling and clattering, and two such merry loads of
rosy-faced children. I wish you had been there; I gave them tea in
the kitchen, and afterward we had a Christmas tree in the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh what fun,&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
you ask us too, Aunt Emma? We could have come quite well in the
train, you know. But how did the children get home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We covered them up warm with rugs and blankets, and sent
them back in the sledges. And they looked so happy with their toys
and buns cuddled up in their arms, that it did one&rsquo;s heart
good to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you ask us next time, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Milly,
hanging round her neck coaxingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you get two pairs of wings by that time,
then,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;for mother&rsquo;s not likely
to let you come to my Christmas tree unless you promise to fly
there and back. But suppose, instead of your coming to me, I come
to you next Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! yes!&rdquo; cried Olly, who had just joined Aunt
Emma and Milly, &ldquo;come to our Christmas tree, Aunt Emma.
We&rsquo;ll give you ever such nice things&mdash;a ball and a top,
and a train&mdash;perhaps&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if Aunt Emma would care for those kind of
things!&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;No, you shall give her some
muffetees, you know, to keep her hands warm, and I&rsquo;ll make
her a needlebook. But, Aunt Emma, do listen! What can be the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were just climbing the little bit of steep road which led
to the farm, and suddenly they heard somebody roaring and
screaming, and then an angry voice scolding, and then a great
clatter, and then louder roaring than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> the matter?&rdquo; cried Milly, running
on to the farm door, which was open. But just as she got there, out
rushed a tattered little figure with a tear-stained face, and hair
flying behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza!&rdquo; cried Milly, trying to stop her. But Tiza
ran past her as quick as lightning down the garden path towards the
cherry tree, and in another minute, in spite of the shower of wet
she shook down on herself as she climbed up, she was sitting high
and safe among the branches, where there was no catching her nor
even seeing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s the best place for ye,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Backhouse, appearing at the door with an angry face,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not get into so much mischief there perhaps as
you will indoors. Oh, is that you, Miss Elliot (that was Aunt
Emma&rsquo;s surname)? Walk in please, ma&rsquo;am, though
you&rsquo;ll find me sadly untidy this afternoon. Tiza&rsquo;s been
at her tricks again; she keeps me sweeping up after her all day.
Just look here, if you please, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Emma went in, and the children pressed in after her, full
of curiosity to see what crime Tiza had been committing. Poor Mrs.
Backhouse! all over her clean kitchen floor there were streams of
water running about, with little pieces of cabbage and carrot
sticking up in them here and there, while on the kitchen table lay
a heap of meat and vegetables, which Mrs. Backhouse had evidently
just picked up out of the grate before Aunt Emma and the children
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Backhouse, pointing to the floor,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the supper just spoilt. Tiza&rsquo;s never
easy but when she&rsquo;s in mischief. I&rsquo;m sure these wet
days I have&rsquo;nt known what to do with her indoors all day. And
what must she do this afternoon but tie her tin mug to the
cat&rsquo;s tail, till the poor creature was nearly beside herself
with fright, and went rushing about upstairs like a mad thing. And
then, just when I happened to be out a minute looking after
something, she lets the cat in here, and the poor thing jumps into
the saucepan I had just put on with the broth for our supper, and
in her fright and all turns it right over. And now look at my
grate, and the fender, and the floor, and the meat there all
messed! I expect her father&rsquo;ll give Tiza a good beating when
he comes in, and I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t stand in the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, please, Mrs. Backhouse!&rdquo; said Milly, running
up to her with a grave imploring little face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let Mr. Backhouse beat her; she didn&rsquo;t mean it, she was only
in fun, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, missy, it&rsquo;s very troiblesome fun I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Backhouse, patting Milly kindly on the
shoulder, for she was a good-natured woman, and it wasn&rsquo;t her
way to be angry long. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m to
give John for his supper, that I don&rsquo;t. I had nothing in the
house but just those little odds and ends of meat, that I thought
would make a nice bit of broth for supper. And now he&rsquo;ll come
in wet and hungry, and there&rsquo;ll be nothing for him. Well, we
must do with something else, I suppose, but I expect her
father&rsquo;ll beat her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly and Olly looked rather awestruck at the idea of a beating
from John Backhouse, that great strong brawny farmer; and Milly,
whispering something quickly to Aunt Emma, slipped out into the
garden again. By this time father and mother had come up, and Becky
appeared from the farmyard, wheeling the baby in a little wooden
cart, and radiant with pleasure at the sight of Aunt Emma, whose
godchild she was, so that Milly&rsquo;s disappearance was not
noticed.</p>
<p>She ran down the garden path to the cherry tree, and as, in the
various times they had been together, Becky and Tiza had taught her
a good deal of climbing, she too clambered up into the wet
branches, and was soon sitting close by Tiza, who had turned her
cotton pinafore over her head and wouldn&rsquo;t look at Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza,&rdquo; said Milly softly, putting her hand on
Tiza&rsquo;s lap, &ldquo;do you feel very bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to take you down to have tea with us,&rdquo; said
Milly, &ldquo;do you think your mother will let you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said Tiza shortly, without moving from behind
her pinafore.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn&rsquo;t very easy talking to Tiza. Milly
thought she&rsquo;d better try something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza,&rdquo; she began timidly, &ldquo;do your father and
mother tell you stories when it rains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said Tiza, in a very astonished voice,
throwing down her pinafore to stare at Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you do, Tiza, when it rains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Tiza. &ldquo;We has our dinners and
tea, and sometimes Becky minds the baby and sometimes I do, and
father mostly goes to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiza,&rdquo; said Milly hurriedly, &ldquo;did you
<em>mean</em> pussy to jump into the saucepan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up went Tiza&rsquo;s pinafore again, and Milly was in dismay
because she thought she had made Tiza cry; but to her great
surprise Tiza suddenly burst into such fits of laughter, that she
nearly tumbled off the cherry tree. &ldquo;Oh, she did jump so, and
the mug made such a rattling! And when she comed out there was just
a little bit of carrot sticking to her nose, and her tail was all
over cabbage leaf. Oh, she did look funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly couldn&rsquo;t help laughing too, till she remembered all
that Mrs. Backhouse had been saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Tiza, Mrs. Backhouse says your father
won&rsquo;t have anything for his supper. Aren&rsquo;t you sorry
you spoilt his supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Tiza, quickly. &ldquo;I know
father&rsquo;ll beat me, he said he would next time I vexed
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this time the pinafore went up in earnest, and Tiza began to
cry piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Tiza,&rdquo; said Milly, her own little
cheeks getting wet, too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beg him not. Can&rsquo;t
you make up anyway? Mother says we must always make up if we can
when we&rsquo;ve done any harm. I wish I had anything to give you
to make up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiza suddenly dried her eyes and looked at Milly, with a bright
expression which was very puzzling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with me,&rdquo; she said suddenly, swinging
herself down from the tree. &ldquo;Come here by the hedge,
don&rsquo;t let mother see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they ran along the far side of the hedge till they got into
the farmyard, and then Tiza led Milly past the hen-house, up to the
corner where the hayricks were. In and out of the hayricks they
went, till in the very farthest corner of all, where hardly anybody
ever came, and which nobody could see into from the yard, Tiza
suddenly knelt down and put her hand under the hay at the bottom of
the rick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come,&rdquo; she whispered eagerly to Milly, pulling
her by the skirt, &ldquo;you come and look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly stooped down, and there in a soft little place, just
between the hayrick and the ground, what do you think she saw?
Three large brownish eggs lying in a sort of rough nest in the hay,
and looking so round and fresh and tempting, that Milly gave a
little cry of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tiza, how be&mdash;utiful! How did they get
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Sally, our white hen you know, laid them.
I found them just after dinner. Mother doesn&rsquo;t know nothing
about them. I never told Becky, nor nobody. Aren&rsquo;t they
beauties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Tiza took one up lovingly in her rough, little brown hands,
and laid it against her cheek, to feel how soft and satiny it
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and Tiza, I know,&rdquo; exclaimed Milly eagerly,
&ldquo;you meant these would do for supper. That would be a lovely
make up. There&rsquo;s three. One for Mr. Backhouse, one for Mrs.
Backhouse, and one for Becky.&mdash;There&rsquo;s none for you,
Tiza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor none for Becky neither,&rdquo; answered Tiza shortly.
&ldquo;Father&rsquo;ll want two. Becky and me&rsquo;ll get bread
and dripping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come along, Tiza, let&rsquo;s take them
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you take them,&rdquo; said Tiza. &ldquo;Mother
won&rsquo;t want to see me no more, and father&rsquo;ll perhaps be
coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Tiza, you&rsquo;ll come to tea with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tiza. &ldquo;You
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off she ran as quick as lightning, off to her hiding-place
in the cherry tree, while Milly was left with the three brown eggs,
feeling rather puzzled and anxious. However, she put them gently in
the skirt of her frock, and holding it up in both hands she picked
her way through the wet yard back to the house.</p>
<p>When she appeared at the kitchen door, Aunt Emma and Mrs.
Backhouse were chatting quietly. Mr. and Mrs. Norton, and Olly, had
gone on for a little stroll along the Wanwick road, and Becky was
sitting on the window-sill with the baby, who seemed very sleepy,
but quite determined not to go to sleep in spite of all
Becky&rsquo;s rocking and patting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Backhouse,&rdquo; began Milly, coming in with a
bright flushed face, &ldquo;just look here, what I&rsquo;ve
brought. Tiza found them just after dinner to-day. They were under
the hayrick right away in the corner, and she wanted to make up, so
she showed me where they were, so I brought them in, and
there&rsquo;s two for Mr. Backhouse, and one for you, you know.
And, please, won&rsquo;t you let Tiza come to tea with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Backhouse looked in astonishment at the three eggs lying in
Milly&rsquo;s print skirt, and at Milly&rsquo;s pleading little
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s Sally, I suppose. She&rsquo;s always
hiding her eggs is Sally, where I can&rsquo;t find them. So it was
Tiza found them, was it, Missy? Well, they will come, in very handy
for supper as it happens. Thank you kindly for bringing them
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Backhouse took the eggs and put them safely away in a
pie-dish, while Becky secretly pulled Milly by the sleeve, and
smiled up at her as much as to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for helping Tiza out of her scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll let Becky and Tiza come to tea?&rdquo;
asked Milly again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure, Miss, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Backhouse, looking puzzled; &ldquo;Becky may come and
welcome, but perhaps it would do Tiza good to stay at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d better have a little
change?&rdquo; said Aunt Emma in her kind voice, which made Milly
want to hug her. &ldquo;I daresay staying indoors so long made her
restless. If you will let me carry them both off, I daresay between
us, Mrs. Backhouse, we can give Tiza a talking to, and perhaps
she&rsquo;ll come back in a more sensible mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Elliot, she shall go if you wish it. Come
Becky, give me the baby, and go and put your things on.&rdquo; And
then going to the door, Mrs. Backhouse shouted &ldquo;Tiza!&rdquo;
After a second or two a little figure dropped down out of the
cherry tree and came slowly up the walk. Tiza had shaken her hair
about her face so that it could hardly be seen, and she never
looked once at Aunt Emma and Milly as she came up to her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, go along, Tiza, and get your things on,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Backhouse, taking her by the arm. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have let you go out to tea, you know, if Miss Elliot and Missy
hadn&rsquo;t asked particular. Mind you don&rsquo;t get into no
more mischief. And very like those eggs&rsquo;ll do for
father&rsquo;s supper; so, I daresay, I&rsquo;ll not say anything
to him this time&mdash;just for once. Now go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiza didn&rsquo;t want to be told twice, and presently, just as
Mr. and Mrs. Norton and Olly were coming back from their walk, they
met Aunt Emma coming back from the farm holding Becky&rsquo;s hand,
while Milly and Tiza walked in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tiza,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, patting her curly
head, I declare I think you beat Olly for mischief. Olly never
spoilt my dinner yet, that I remember. What should I do to him do
you think, if he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat him,&rdquo; said Tiza, looking up at Mr. Norton with
her quick birdlike eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, &ldquo;that
wouldn&rsquo;t do my dinner any good. I should eat him up
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe little boys taste good a
bit,&rdquo; said Olly, who always believed firmly in his
father&rsquo;s various threats. &ldquo;If you ettened me, father,
you&rsquo;d be ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, &ldquo;not if I eat you
with plenty of bread-sauce. That&rsquo;s the best way to cook
little boys. Now, Milly, which of you three girls can get to that
gate first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off ran the three little girls full tilt down the hill leading
to Ravensnest, with Olly puffing and panting after them. Milly led
the way at first, for she was light and quick, and a very fair
runner for her age; but Tiza soon got up to her and passed her, and
it was Tiza&rsquo;s little stout legs that arrived first at
Ravensnest gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Becky!&rdquo; said Milly, putting her arm round
Becky&rsquo;s neck as they went into the house together, &ldquo;I
hope you may stay a good long time. What time do you go to
bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Becky. &ldquo;We go
when fayther goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When fayther goes!&rdquo; exclaimed Milly. &ldquo;Why, we
go ever so long before father. Why do you stay up so
late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t late,&rdquo; said Becky.
&ldquo;Fayther goes to bed, now it&rsquo;s summertime, about
half-past eight; but in winter, of course, he goes earlier. And we
all goes together, except baby. Mother puts him out of the way
before supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but how funny,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t think why you should be so different from
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Milly went on puzzling over Becky and her going to bed, till
nurse drove it all out of her head by fetching them to tea. Such a
merry tea they had, and after tea a romp in the big kitchen with
father, which delighted the little farm children beyond measure.
Some time in the evening, I believe, Aunt Emma managed to give Tiza
a little talking to, but none of the other children knew anything
about it, except perhaps Becky, who generally knew what was
happening to Tiza.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter9" name="Chapter9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<h3>MILLY&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Now we have come to a chapter which is going to be half merry
and half sad. I have not told you any sad things about Milly and
Olly up till now, I think. They were such happy little people, that
there was nothing sad to tell you. They cried sometimes, of
course&mdash;you remember Milly cried when Olly stickied her
doll&mdash;but generally, by the time they had dried up their tears
they had quite forgotten what they were crying about; and as for
any real trouble, why they didn&rsquo;t know what it could possibly
be like. But now, just as they were going away from Ravensnest,
came a real sad thing, and you&rsquo;ll hear very soon how it
happened.</p>
<p>After those three wet days it was sometimes fine and sometimes
rainy at Ravensnest, but never so rainy as to keep the Nortons in
all day. And every now and then there were splendid days, when the
children and their father and mother were out all day long,
wandering over the mountains, or walking over to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
or tramping along the well-known roads to Wanwick on one side, and
the little village of Rydal and Rydal Lake on the other. They had
another row on Windermere; and one fine evening Mr. Norton borrowed
a friend&rsquo;s boat, and they went out fishing for perch on Rydal
Lake, the loveliest little lake in the world, lying softly in a
green mountain cup, and dotted with islands, which seemed to the
children when they landed on them like little bits of fairyland
dropped into the blue water.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="images/illus7.png"><img src=
"images/illus7.png" alt="&ldquo;Haymaking&rdquo;" id="illus7" name=
"illus7" width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;Haymaking&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And then! crown of delights! came the haymaking. There were long
fine days, when the six small creatures&mdash;Milly, Olly, Becky,
Tiza, Bessie, and Charlie&mdash;followed John Backhouse and his men
about in the hayfields from early morning till evening, helping to
make the hay, or simply rolling about like a parcel of kittens in
the flowery fragrant heaps.</p>
<p>Aunt Emma was often at Ravensnest, and the children learned to
love her better and better, so that even wild little Olly would
remember to bring her stool, and carry her shawl, and change her
plate at dinner; and Milly, who was always clinging to somebody,
was constantly puzzled to know whose pocket to sit in,
mother&rsquo;s or Aunt Emma&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then there was the farmyard, the cows, and the milking, and the
chickens. Everything about them seemed delightful to Milly and
Olly, and the top of everything was reached when one evening John
Backhouse mounted both the children on his big carthorse Dobbin,
and they and Dobbin together dragged the hay home in triumph.</p>
<p>And now they had only one week more to stay at Ravensnest. But
that week was a most important week, for it was to contain no less
a day than Milly&rsquo;s birthday. Milly would be seven years old
on the 15th of July, and for about a week before the 15th,
Milly&rsquo;s little head could think of nothing else. Olly too was
very much excited about it, for though Milly of course was the
queen of the day, and all the presents were for her, not for him,
still it was good times for everybody on Milly&rsquo;s birthday;
besides which, he had his own little secret with mother about his
present to Milly, a secret which made him very happy, but which he
was on the point of telling at least a hundred times a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Milly, about four days before the
birthday, when they were all wandering about after tea one evening
in the high garden which was now a paradise of ripe red
strawberries and fruit of every kind, &ldquo;does everybody have
birthdays? Do policemen have birthdays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect so, Milly,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, laughing,
&ldquo;but they haven&rsquo;t any time to remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, what&rsquo;s the good of having birthdays if
you don&rsquo;t keep them, and have presents and all that? And do
cats and dogs have birthdays? I should like to find out
Spot&rsquo;s birthday. We&rsquo;d give her cream instead of milk,
you know, and I&rsquo;d tie a blue ribbon round her neck, and one
round her tail like the queen&rsquo;s sheep in mother&rsquo;s
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Spot would thank you at all,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton. &ldquo;The cream would make her ill, and the
ribbon would fidget her dreadfully till she pulled it
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Milly. &ldquo;Well, I suppose Spot
had better not have any birthday then. But, father, what do you
think? Becky and Tiza don&rsquo;t care about their birthdays a bit.
Becky could hardly remember when hers was, and they never have any
presents unless Aunt Emma gives them one, or people to tea, or
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Milly, when people have only just pennies
and shillings enough to buy bread and meat to eat, and clothes to
put on, they can&rsquo;t go spending money on presents; and when
they&rsquo;re very anxious and busy all the year round they
can&rsquo;t be remembering birthdays and taking pains about them
like richer people can, who have less to trouble them, and whose
work does not take up quite so much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but why don&rsquo;t the rich people remember the
poor people&rsquo;s birthdays for them, father? Then they could
give them presents, and ask them to tea and all, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be a very good arrangement,&rdquo; said
Mr. Norton, smiling at her eager little face. &ldquo;Only, somehow,
Milly, things don&rsquo;t come right like that in this
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to try and remember Becky&rsquo;s
and Tiza&rsquo;s birthdays,&rdquo; said Milly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell mother to put them down in her pocket-book&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you, mother? Oh, what fun! I&rsquo;ll send them birthday cards, and
they&rsquo;ll be so surprised, and wonder why; and then
they&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh, why, of course it&rsquo;s our
birthday!&rsquo;&mdash;No, not <em>our</em> birthday&mdash;but you
know what I mean, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, Milly,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Norton, &ldquo;have
you made up your mind what you want to do this birthday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly stopped suddenly, with her hands behind her, opposite her
mother, with her lips tightly pressed together, her eyes smiling,
as if there was a tremendous secret hidden somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, monkey, out with it. What have you got hidden away
in your little head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said Milly, slowly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to <em>have</em> anybody to tea. I want to go out
to tea with somebody. Now can you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Aunt Emma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Aunt Emma&rsquo;s coming over here all day. She
promised she would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Becky and Tiza?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly nodded, and screwed up her little lips tighter than
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect Mrs. Backhouse will want the
trouble of having you two to tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother, she won&rsquo;t mind a bit. I know she
won&rsquo;t; because Becky told me one day her mother would like us
very much to come some time if you&rsquo;d let us. And Nana could
come and help Mrs. Backhouse, and we could all wash up the
tea-things afterwards, like we did at the picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Tiza mustn&rsquo;t sit next me,&rdquo; said Olly,
who had been listening in silence to all the arrangements.
&ldquo;She takes away my bread and butter when I&rsquo;m not
looking, and I don&rsquo;t like it, not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Olly dear, she shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Milly,
taking his hand and fondling it, as if she were at least twenty
years older. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit on one side of you and Becky on
the other,&rdquo; a prospect with which Olly was apparently
satisfied, for he made no more objections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must ask Mrs. Backhouse yourselves,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Norton. &ldquo;And if it is her washing-day, or inconvenient
to her at all, you mustn&rsquo;t think of going, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So early next morning, Milly and Nana and Olly went up to the
farm, and came back with the answer that Mrs. Backhouse would be
very pleased to see them at tea on Thursday, the 15th, and that
John Backhouse would have cut the hay-field by the river by then,
and they could have a romp in the hay afterwards.</p>
<p>Wednesday was a deeply interesting day to Olly. He and his
mother went over by themselves to Wanwick, and they bought
something which the shopwoman at the toy-shop wrapped up in a neat
little parcel, and which Olly carried home, looking as important as
a little king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; he began at dinner,
&ldquo;<em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> you like to know about your
presents? But of course I shan&rsquo;t tell you about mine. Perhaps
I&rsquo;m not going to give you one at all. Oh, mother,&rdquo; in a
loud whisper to Mrs. Norton, &ldquo;did you put it away safe where
she can&rsquo;t see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly boy,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
tell me if you don&rsquo;t take care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you if you were
to go on asking me all day. It isn&rsquo;t very big, you know,
Milly, and&mdash;and&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t pretty
outside&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, chatterbox,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton putting his
hand over Olly&rsquo;s mouth, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll tell in another
minute, and then there&rsquo;ll be no fun to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Olly with great difficulty kept quiet, and began eating up
his pudding very fast, as if that was the only way of keeping his
little tongue out of mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said after dinner, &ldquo;do take Milly
out for a walk, and mother shall take me. Then I can&rsquo;t tell,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two went out different ways, and Olly kept away from
Milly all day, in great fear lest somehow or other his secret
should fly out of him in spite of all his efforts to keep it in. At
night the children made nurse hurry them to bed, so that when
mother came to tuck them up, as she generally did, she found the
pair fast asleep, and nothing left to kiss but two curly heads
buried in the pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless their hearts,&rdquo; said nurse to Mrs. Norton,
&ldquo;they can think of nothing but to-morrow. They&rsquo;ll be
sadly disappointed if it rains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stars came out, and the new moon shone softly all night
on the great fir trees and the rosebuds and the little dancing beck
in the Ravensnest garden; and when Milly awoke next morning the sun
was shining, and Brownholme was towering up clear and high into the
breezy blue sky, and the trees were throwing cool shadows on the
dewy lawn around the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Milly, jumping up, her face flushing
with joy &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my birthday, and it&rsquo;s fine. Nana,
bring me my things, please.&mdash;But where&rsquo;s
Olly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where indeed was Olly? There was his little bed, but there was a
nightdress rolled up in it, and not a wisp of his brown curls was
to be seen anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Milly, are you woke up at last? I hardly
thought you&rsquo;d have slept so late this morning. Many happy
returns of the day to you,&rdquo; said nurse, giving her a hearty
hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, <em>dear</em> nurse. Oh, it is so nice having
birthdays. But where can Olly be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble your head about him,&rdquo; said
nurse mysteriously, and not another word could Milly get out of
her. She had just slipped on her white cotton frock when mother
opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, birthday-girl! The top of the morning to you, and
many, many happy returns of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Milly and mother went through a great deal of kissing
which need not be described, and then mother helped her brush her
hair, and put on her ribbon and tie her sash, so that in another
minute or two she was quite ready to go down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Milly, wait one minute till you hear the bell ring,
and then you may come down as fast as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Milly waited, her little feet dancing with impatience, till
the bell began to ring as if it had gone quite mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Olly ringing,&rdquo; cried Milly,
rushing off. And sure enough when she got to the hall there was
Olly ringing as if he meant to bring the house down. He dropped the
bell when he saw Milly, and dragged her breathlessly into the
dining-room.</p>
<p>And what did Milly see there I wonder? Why, a heap of red and
white roses lying on the breakfast table, a big heap, with odd
corners and points sticking up all over it, and under the roses a
white napkin, and under the napkin treasures of all sorts&mdash;a
book from father, a little work-box from mother, with a picture of
Windermere on the outside, and inside the most delightful cottons
and needles and bits of bright-coloured stuffs; a china
doll&rsquo;s dinner-service from Aunt Emma, a mug from nurse, a
little dish full of big red strawberries from gardener, and last,
but not least, Olly&rsquo;s present&mdash;a black paint-box, with
colours and brushes and all complete, and tied up with a little
drawing-book which mother had added to make it really useful. At
the top of the heap, too, lay two letters addressed in very big
round hand to &ldquo;Miss Milly Norton,&rdquo; and one was signed
Jacky and the other signed Francis. Each of these presents had neat
little labels fastened on to them, and they were smothered in
roses&mdash;deep red and pale pink roses, with the morning dew
sprinkled over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got all those roses, mother and me, this morning, when
you was fast asleep, Milly,&rdquo; shouted Olly, who was capering
about like a mad creature. &ldquo;Mother pulled me out of bed ever
so early, and I putted on my goloshes, and didn&rsquo;t we get wet
just! Milly, <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> my paint-box a beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s no good trying to describe what Milly felt. She
felt as every happy little girl feels on a happy birthday, just a
little bit bewitched, as if she had got into another kind of world
altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said father, after breakfast,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours, Milly, for all this morning. What are you
going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make you into a tiger, father, and shoot you,&rdquo; said
Olly, who would have liked to play at hunting and shooting games
all day long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not yours, I&rsquo;m Milly&rsquo;s. Now, Milly,
what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take us right to the top of Brownholme, father?
You know we haven&rsquo;t been to the very top yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll go if your legs will carry you.
But you must ask them very particularly first how they feel, for
it&rsquo;ll be stiff work for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not very long after breakfast, and before they started for their
walk, Aunt Emma&rsquo;s pony carriage came rattling up the drive,
and she, too, brought flowers for Milly, above all a bunch of
water-lilies all wet from the lake; and then she and mother settled
under the trees with their books and work while the children
started on their walk.</p>
<p>But first Milly had drawn mother into a corner where no one
could see, and there, with a couple of tears in her two blue eyes,
she had whispered in a great hurry, so that Mrs. Norton could
scarcely hear, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have everything just as
<em>I</em> like, to-day, mother. Can&rsquo;t I do what somebody
else likes? I&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which means that Milly was a good deal excited, and her heart
very full, and that she was thinking of how, a year before, her
birthday had been rather spoilt toward the end of it by a little
bit of crossness and self-will, that she remembered afterward with
a pang for many a long day. Since then, Milly had learnt a good
deal more of that long, long lesson, which we go on learning, big
people and little people, all our lives&mdash;the lesson of
self-forgetting&mdash;of how love brings joy, and to be selfish is
to be sad; and her birthday seemed to bring back to her all that
she had been learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norton, putting back
her tangled hair from her anxious little face, &ldquo;go and be
happy. That&rsquo;s what we all like to-day. Besides, you&rsquo;ll
find plenty of ways of doing what other people like before the end
of the day without my inventing any. Run along now, and climb away.
Mind you don&rsquo;t let Olly tumble into bogs, and mind you bring
me a bunch of ferns for the dinner-table&mdash;and there&rsquo;ll
be two things done at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away ran Milly; and all the morning she and Olly and father
scrambled and climbed, and raced and chatted, on the green back of
old Brownholme. They went to say good-morning to John
Backhouse&rsquo;s cows in the &ldquo;intake,&rdquo; as he called
his top field, and they just peeped over the wall at the fierce
young bull he had bought at Penrith fair a few days before, and
which looked as if, birthdays or no birthdays, he could have eaten
Milly at two mouthfuls, and swallowed Olly down afterwards without
knowing it.</p>
<p>Then they climbed and climbed after father, till, just as Olly
was beginning to feel his legs to make sure they weren&rsquo;t
falling off, they were so tired and shaky&mdash;there they were
standing on the great pile of stones which marks the top of the
mountain&mdash;the very tip-top of all its green points and rocks
and grassy stretches. By this time the children knew the names of
most of the mountains around, and of all the lakes. They went
through them now like a lesson with their father; and even Olly
remembered a great many, and could chatter about Helvellyn, and
Fairfield, and Langdale Pikes, as if he had trudged to the top of
them all himself.</p>
<p>Then came the getting down again. Father and Milly and Olly
hand-in-hand, racing over the short fine grass, startling the
little black-faced sheep, and racing down the steep bits, where
Milly and Olly generally tumbled over in some sort of a heap at the
bottom. As for the flowers they gathered, there were so many I have
no time to tell you about them&mdash;wood-flowers and bog-flowers
and grass-flowers, and ferns of all sizes to mix with them, from
the great Osmunda, which grew along the Ravensnest Beck, down to
the tiny little parsley fern. It was all delightful&mdash;the
sights and the sounds, and the fresh mountain wind that blew them
about on the top so that long afterward Milly used to look back to
that walk on Brownholme when she was seven years old as one of the
merriest times she ever spent.</p>
<p>Dinner was very welcome after all this scrambling; and after
dinner came a quiet time in the garden, when father read aloud to
mother and Aunt Emma, and the children kept still and listened to
as much as they could understand, at least until they went to
sleep, which they both did lying on a rug at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
feet. Milly couldn&rsquo;t understand how this had happened at all,
when she found herself waking up and rubbing her eyes, but I think
it was natural enough after their long walk in the sun and
wind.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock nurse came for them, and when they had
been put into clean frocks and pinafores, she took them up to the
farm. Milly and Olly felt that this was a very solemn occasion, and
they walked up to the farmhouse door hand-in-hand, feeling as shy
as if they had never been there before. But at the door were Becky
and Tiza waiting for them, as smart as new pins, with shining hair,
and red ribbons under their little white collars; and the children
no sooner caught sight of one another than all their shyness flew
away, and they began to chatter as usual.</p>
<p>In the farmhouse kitchen were Bessie and Charlie, and such a
comfortable tea spread out on a long table, covered with a red and
black woollen table-cloth instead of a white one. Becky and Tiza
had filled two tumblers with meadow-sweet and blue campanula, which
stood up grandly in the middle, and there were two home-made cakes
at each end, and some of Sally&rsquo;s brown eggs, and piles of
tempting bread and butter.</p>
<p>Each of the children had their gift for Milly too: Becky had
plaited her a basket of rushes, a thing she had often tried to
teach Milly how to make for herself, and Tiza pushed a bunch of
wild raspberries into her hand, and ran away before Milly could say
thank you; Bessie shyly produced a Christmas card that somebody had
once sent to her; and even Charlie had managed to provide himself
with a bunch of the wild yellow poppies which grew on the wall of
the Ravensnest garden, and were a joy to all beholders.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Backhouse put Milly at one end of the table, while she
began to pour out tea at the other, and the feast began. Certainly,
Milly thought, it was much more exciting going out to tea at a
farmhouse than having children to tea with you at home, just as you
might anywhere, on any day in the year. There were the big hens
coming up to the door and poking in their long necks to take a look
at them; there were the pigeons circling round and round in the
yard; there was the sound of milking going on in the shed close by,
and many other sights and sounds which were new and strange and
delightful.</p>
<p>As for Olly, he was very much taken up for a time with the red
and black table-cloth, and could not be kept from peering
underneath it from time to time, as if he suspected that the white
table-cloth he was generally accustomed to had been hidden away
underneath for a joke. But when the time for cake came, Olly forgot
the table-cloth altogether. He had never seen a cake quite like the
bun-loaf, which kind Mrs. Backhouse had made herself for the
occasion, and of which she had given him a hunch, so in his usual
inquisitive way he began to turn it over and over, as if by looking
at it long enough he could find out how it was made and all about
it. Presently, when the others were all quietly enjoying their
bun-loaf, Olly&rsquo;s shrill little voice was heard
saying&mdash;while he put two separate fingers on two out of the
few currants in his piece:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> currant says to <em>that</em> currant,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m here, where are you? You&rsquo;re so far off I
can&rsquo;t see you nowhere.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olly, be quiet,&rdquo; said Milly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, Milly, I can&rsquo;t help it; it&rsquo;s so
funny. There&rsquo;s only three currants in my bit, and cookie puts
such a lot in at home. I&rsquo;m pretending they&rsquo;re little
children wanting to play, only they can&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re so
far off. There, I&rsquo;ve etten one up. Now there&rsquo;s only
two. That&rsquo;s you and me, Milly. I&rsquo;ll eat you up
first&mdash;krick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about the currants, little master,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Backhouse, laughing at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice and sweet
any way, and you can eat as much of it as you like, which is more
than you can of rich cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olly thought there was something in this, and by the time he had
got through his second bit of bun-loaf he had quite made up his
mind that he would get Susan to make bun-loaves at home too.</p>
<p>They were just finishing tea when there was a great clatter
outside, and by came the hay-cart with John Backhouse leading the
horse, and two men walking beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to carry all the hay in yon lower field
presently,&rdquo; he shouted to his wife as he passed. &ldquo;Send
the young &lsquo;uns down to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up they all started, and presently the whole party were racing
down the hill to the riverfield, with Mrs. Backhouse and her baby
walking soberly with nurse behind them. Yes, there lay the hay
piled up in large cocks on the fresh clean-swept carpet of bright
green grass, and in the middle of the field stood the hay-cart with
two horses harnessed, one man standing in it to press down and
settle the hay as John Backhouse and two other men handed it up to
him on pitchforks. Olly went head over heels into the middle of one
of the cocks, followed by Charlie, and would have liked to go head
over heels into all the rest, but Mr. Norton, who had come into the
field with mother and Aunt Emma, told him he must be content to
play with two cocks in one of the far corners of the field without
disturbing the others, which were all ready for carrying, and that
if he and Charlie strewed the hay about they must tidy it up before
John Backhouse wanted to put it on the cart. So Olly and Charlie
went off to their corner, and for a little while all the other
children played there too. Milly had invented a game called the
&ldquo;Babes in the Wood,&rdquo; in which two children were the
babes and pretended to die on the grass, and all the rest were the
robins, and covered them up with hay instead of leaves. She and
Tiza made beautiful babes: they put their handkerchiefs over their
faces and lay as still as mice, till Olly had piled so much hay on
the top of them that there was not a bit of them to be seen
anywhere, while Bessie began to cry out as if she was suffocated
before they had put two good armfuls over her.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Milly got tired; and she and Tiza walked off
by themselves and sat down by the river to get cool. The water in
the river was quite low again now, and the children could watch the
tiny minnows darting and flashing about by the bank, and even amuse
themselves by fancying every now and then that they saw a trout
shooting across the clear brown water. Tiza had quite left off
being shy now with Milly, and the two chattered away, Milly telling
Tiza all about her school, and Jacky and Francis, and Spot and the
garden at home; and Tiza telling Milly about her father&rsquo;s new
bull, how frightened she and Becky were of him, and how father
meant to make the fence stronger for fear he should get out and
toss people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy little party,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma to
mother looking round the field; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like
hay for children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the hay-cart was quite full, and crack went John
Backhouse&rsquo;s whip, as he took hold of the first horse&rsquo;s
head and gave him a pull forward to start the cart on its way to
the farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-up,&rdquo; shouted John in his loud cheery voice, and
the horse made a step forward, while the children round cried
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; and waved their hands. But suddenly there was
a loud piteous cry which made John give the horse a sudden push
back and drop his whip, and then, from where they sat, Milly and
Tiza heard a sound of crying and screaming, while everybody in the
field ran toward the hay-cart. They ran too; what could have
happened?</p>
<p>Just as they came up to the crowd of people round the cart,
Milly saw her father with something in his arms. And this something
was Becky&mdash;poor little Becky, with a great mark on her temple,
and her eyes quite shut, and such a white face!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! mother!&rdquo; cried Milly, rushing up to
her, &ldquo;tell me, mother, what is the matter with
Becky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Norton had no time to attend to her. She was running to
meet Mrs. Backhouse, who had come hurrying up from another part of
the field with the baby in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was under the cart when it moved on,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Norton, taking the baby from her. &ldquo;We none of us know how it
happened. She must have been trying to hand up some hay at the last
moment and tumbled under. I don&rsquo;t think her head is much
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On ran Mrs. Backhouse, and Milly and her mother followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me carry her up now without moving her,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, as Mrs. Backhouse tried to take the little bundle
from him. &ldquo;She has fainted, I think. We must get some water
at the stream.&rdquo; So on he went, with the pale frightened
mother, while the others followed. Aunt Emma had got Tiza and Milly
by the hand, and was trying to comfort them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope she is not much hurt, darlings; the wheel did not
go over her, thank God. It was just upon her when her father backed
the horse. But it must have crushed her I&rsquo;m afraid, and there
was something hanging under the cart which gave her that knock on
the temple. Look, there is one of the men starting off for the
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Tiza, who had kept quiet till then, burst into a loud
fit of crying, and threw herself down on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse,&rdquo; called Aunt Emma, &ldquo;stay here with
these two poor little ones while I go and see if I can be of any
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So nurse came and sat beside them, and Milly crept up to her for
comfort. But poor little Tiza lay with her face buried in the grass
and nothing they could say to her seemed to reach her little deaf
ears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aunt Emma hurried after the others, and presently
caught them up at a stream where Mr. Norton had stopped to bathe
Becky&rsquo;s head and face. The cold water had just revived her
when Aunt Emma came up, and for one moment she opened her heavy
blue eyes and looked at her mother, who was bending over her, and
then they shut again. But her little hand went feebly searching for
her mother, who caught it up and kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Emma, Miss Emma,&rdquo; she said, pointing to
the child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard but she&rsquo;s badly
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, with all my heart,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma,
gently taking her arm. &ldquo;But the doctor will soon be here; we
must get her home before he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So on they went again, Mr. Norton still carrying Becky, and Mr.
Backhouse helping his wife along. Mrs. Norton had got the baby safe
in her motherly arms, and so they all toiled up the hill to the
farmhouse. What a difference from the merry party that ran down the
hill only an hour before!</p>
<p>They laid Becky down on her mother&rsquo;s bed, and then Aunt
Emma, finding that Mrs. Norton wished to stay till the doctor came,
went back to the children. She found a sad little group sitting in
the hay-field; Milly in nurse&rsquo;s lap crying quietly every now
and then; Tiza still sobbing on the grass, and Olly who had just
crept down from the farmhouse, where he and Charlie had seen Becky
carried in, talking to nurse in eager whispers, as if he
daren&rsquo;t talk out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; cried Milly, when she opened the
gate, &ldquo;is she better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, I think, Milly, but the doctor will soon be
here, and then we shall know all about it. Tiza, you poor little
woman, Mrs. Wheeler says you must sleep with them to-night. Your
mother will want the house very quiet, and to-morrow, you know, you
can go and see Becky if the doctor says you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Tiza began to cry again more piteously than ever. It
seemed so dreary and terrible to her to be shut out from home
without Becky. But Aunt Emma sat down on the grass beside her, and
lifted her up and talked to her; with anybody else Tiza would have
kicked and struggled, for she was a curious, passionate child, and
her grief was always wild and angry, but nobody could struggle with
Aunt Emma, and at last she let herself be comforted a little by the
tender voice and soft caressing hand. She stopped crying, and then
they all took her up to the Wheelers&rsquo;s cottage, where Mrs.
Wheeler, a kind motherly body, took her in, and promised that she
should know everything there was to be known about Becky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Milly, presently, when they were
all sitting in the conservatory which ran round the house, waiting
for Mr. Norton to bring them news from the farm, &ldquo;how did
Becky tumble under the cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was lifting up some hay, I think, which had fallen
off, and one of the men was stooping down to take it on his fork,
and then she must have slipped and fallen right under the cart,
just as John Backhouse told the horse to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if the wheel <em>had</em> gone over!&rdquo; said
Milly, shuddering. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a sad birthday, Aunt Emma,
and we were so happy a little while ago? And then I can&rsquo;t
understand. I don&rsquo;t know why it happens like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Emma, always in stories, you know, it&rsquo;s
the bad people get hurt and die. And now it&rsquo;s poor little
Becky that&rsquo;s hurt. And she&rsquo;s such a dear little girl,
and helps her mother so. I don&rsquo;t think she ought to have been
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anything about &lsquo;oughts,&rsquo;
Milly, darling, you and I. God knows, we trust, and that helps many
people who love God to be patient when they are in trouble or pain.
But think if it had been poor mischievous little Tiza who had been
hurt, how she would have fretted. And now very likely Becky will
bear it beautifully, and so, without knowing it, she will be
teaching Tiza to be patient, and it will do Tiza good to have to
help Becky and take care of her for a bit, instead of letting Becky
always look after her and get her out of scrapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and Aunt Emma, can&rsquo;t we all take care of Becky?
What can Olly and I do?&rdquo; said Milly, imploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go and sing all my songs to Becky,&rdquo; said
Olly, looking up brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-and-by, perhaps,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, smiling and
patting his head. &ldquo;But hark! isn&rsquo;t that father&rsquo;s
step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had grown so dark that they could hardly see who it was
opening the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it is,&rdquo; cried Milly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
father and mother.&rdquo; Away they ran to meet them, and Mrs.
Norton took Milly&rsquo;s little pale face in both her hands and
kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not <em>very</em> badly hurt, darling. The
doctor says she must lie quite quiet for two or three weeks, and
then he hopes she&rsquo;ll be all right. The wheel gave her a
squeeze, which jarred her poor little back and head very much, but
it didn&rsquo;t break anything, and if she lies very quite the
doctor thinks she&rsquo;ll get quite well again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh
mother! and does Tiza know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have just been to tell her. Mrs. Wheeler had put
her to bed, but she went up to give her our message, and she said
poor little Tiza began to cry again, and wanted us to tell her
mother she would be <em>so</em> quiet if only they would let her
come back to Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days, perhaps. But she is not to see anybody but
Mrs. Backhouse for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Milly, while the tears came into
her eyes again. &ldquo;We shall be going away so soon, and we
can&rsquo;t say good-bye. Isn&rsquo;t it sad, mother, just
happening last thing? and we&rsquo;ve been so happy all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Milly,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, lifting her on to his
knee. &ldquo;This is the first really sad thing that ever happened
to you in your little life I think. Mother, and I, and Aunt Emma,
tell you stories about sad things, but that&rsquo;s very different,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Milly, thinking. &ldquo;Father, are
there as many sad things really as there are in stories?&mdash;you
know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a great many sad things and sad people in the
world, Milly. We don&rsquo;t have monsters plaguing us like King
Hrothgar, but every day there is trouble and grief going on
somewhere, and we happy and strong people must care for the sad
ones if we want to do our duty and help to straighten the world a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; whispered Milly, softly, &ldquo;will you
tell us how&mdash;Olly and me? We would if we knew how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Milly, suppose you begin with Becky, and poor Tiza
too, indeed. I wonder whether a pair of little people could make a
scrap-book for Becky to look at when she is getting
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, yes!&rdquo; said Milly, joyfully,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got ever so many pictures in mother&rsquo;s
writing-book, she let me cut out of her &lsquo;Graphics,&rsquo; and
Olly can help paste; can&rsquo;t you, Olly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olly generally pastes his face more than anything
else,&rdquo; said Mr. Norton, giving a sly pull at his brown curls.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not very much mistaken, there is a little fairy
pasting up your eyes, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleepy, not a bit,&rdquo; said Olly,
sitting bolt upright and blinking very fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re not sleepy, but just asleep,&rdquo;
said Mr. Norton, catching him up in his arms, and carrying him to
his mother to say good-night.</p>
<p>Milly went very soberly and quietly up to bed, and for some
little time she lay awake, her little heart feeling very sore and
heavy about the &ldquo;sad things&rdquo; in the world. Then with
her thoughts full of Becky she fell asleep.</p>
<p>So ended Milly&rsquo;s birthday, a happy day and a sorrowful
day, all in one. When Milly grew older there was no birthday just
before or after it she remembered half so clearly as that on which
she was seven years old.</p>
<h2><a id="Chapter10" name="Chapter10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
<h3>Last Days at Ravensnest</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>On Friday morning the children and their father trudged up very
early to the farm to get news of Becky. She had had a bad night Mr.
Backhouse said, but she had taken some milk and beef-tea; she knew
her father and mother quite well, and she had asked twice for Tiza.
The doctor said they must just be patient. Quiet and rest would
make her well again, and nothing else, and Tiza was not to go home
for a day or two.</p>
<p>As for poor Tiza, a long sleep had cheered her up greatly, and
when Milly and Olly went to take her out with them after breakfast,
they found her almost as merry and chatty as usual. But she
didn&rsquo;t like being kept at the Wheelers&rsquo;s, though they
were very kind to her; and it was all Mrs. Wheeler could do to
prevent her from slipping up to the farm unknown to anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have porridge for breakfast,&rdquo; said
Tiza, tossing her head, when she and Milly were out together.
&ldquo;Mother always gives us porridge. And I won&rsquo;t sit next
Charlie. He&rsquo;s always dirtying hisself. He stickied hisself
just all over this morning with treacle. Mother would have given
him a clout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, on the whole, she was as good as such a wild creature
could be, and the children and she had some capital times together.
Wheeler the gardener let them gather strawberries and currants for
making jam, a delightful piece of work, which helped to keep Tiza
out of mischief and make her contented with staying away from home
more than anything else. At last, after three days, the doctor said
she might come home if she would promise to be quiet in the house.
So one bright evening Tiza slipped into the farmhouse and squeezed
in after her mother to the little room where Becky was lying, a
white-faced feverish little creature, low down among the
pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becky,&rdquo; said Tiza, sitting down beside her sister,
as if nothing had happened, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s some strawberries.
Wheeler gave me some. You can have some if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one,&rdquo; said Becky, in her weak shaky voice,
smiling at her; and Tiza knelt on the bed and stuffed one softly
into her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to nurse baby now, Tiza,&rdquo; said
Becky presently; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been under mother&rsquo;s feet
terrible. Mind you don&rsquo;t let him eat nasty things.
He&rsquo;ll get at the coals if you don&rsquo;t mind
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let him,&rdquo; said Tiza shortly, setting
to work on her own strawberries.</p>
<p>All this didn&rsquo;t sound very affectionate; but I think all
the same Tiza did love Becky, and I believe she tried to do her
best in her own funny way while Becky was ill. Baby screamed a good
deal certainly when she nursed him, and it was quite impossible of
course for Tiza to keep out of mischief altogether for two or three
weeks. Still, on the whole, she was a help to her mother; while as
for Becky she was never quite happy when Tiza was out of the house.
Becky, like Milly, had a way of loving everybody about her, and
next to her mother she loved Tiza best of anybody.</p>
<p>After all, the children were able to say good-bye to Becky. Just
the day before they were to go away Mr. Backhouse came down to say
that Becky would like to see them very much if they could come, and
the doctor said they might.</p>
<p>So up they went; Milly a good deal excited, and Olly very
curious to see what Becky would look like. Mr. Backhouse took them
in, and they found Becky lying comfortably on a little bed, with a
patchwork counterpane, and her shoulders and arms covered up in a
red flannel dressing-gown that Aunt Emma had sent her.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="images/illus8.png"><img src=
"images/illus8.png" alt=
"&ldquo;&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a bump?&rsquo; asked Olly&rdquo;"
id="illus8" name="illus8" width="100%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a bump?&rsquo; asked
Olly&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Milly kissed her, and Olly shook her hand, and they didn&rsquo;t
all quite know what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your back better?&rdquo; said Milly at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad the doctor let us come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a bump?&rdquo; asked Olly, looking
at her with all his eyes. &ldquo;We thought you&rsquo;d have a
great black bump on your fore-head, you know&mdash;ever so
big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a cut,&rdquo; said Becky; &ldquo;there
now, you can see how it&rsquo;s plastered up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it hurt?&rdquo; said Olly, &ldquo;did you kick? I
should have kicked. And does the doctor give you nasty
medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any now.
And it wasn&rsquo;t nasty at all what I had first. And now I may
have strawberries and raspberries, and Mr. Wheeler sends mother a
plate everyday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair that little boys
shouldn&rsquo;t never be ill,&rdquo; said Olly, with his eyes
fastened on Becky&rsquo;s plate of strawberries, which was on the
chest of drawers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you funny boy,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;why, mother
gives you some every day though you aren&rsquo;t ill; and I&rsquo;m
sure you wouldn&rsquo;t like staying in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should,&rdquo; said Olly, just for the sake of
contradicting. &ldquo;Do you know, Becky, we&rsquo;ve got a secret,
and we&rsquo;re not to tell it you, only Milly and I are going
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Milly, putting her hand over,
his mouth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell in a minute. You&rsquo;re
always telling secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just half, Milly, I won&rsquo;t tell it all you
know. It&rsquo;s just like something burning inside my mouth.
We&rsquo;re going to make you something, Becky, when we get home.
Something be&mdash;ootiful, you know. And you can look at it in
bed, and we won&rsquo;t make it big, so you can turn over the
pages, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Olly,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I should think
Becky&rsquo;ll guess now. It&rsquo;ll come by post, Becky.
Mother&rsquo;s going to help us make it. You&rsquo;ll like it I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;a picture-book!&rdquo;
said Olly, in a loud whisper, putting his head down to Becky.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you unkind boy,&rdquo; said Milly, pouting.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never have a secret with you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Becky looked very pleased, and said she would like a
picture-book she thought very much, for it was dull sometimes when
mother was busy and Tiza was nursing baby. So perhaps, after all,
it didn&rsquo;t matter having told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to you, Becky,&rdquo; said
Milly, when the time came to go away, &ldquo;and at Christmas
I&rsquo;ll send you a Christmas card, and perhaps some day
we&rsquo;ll come here again you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll milk the cows,&rdquo; said Olly,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t we, Becky? And I&rsquo;ll ride on your big
horse. Mr. Backhouse says I may ride all alone some day when
I&rsquo;m big; when I&rsquo;m sixty&mdash;no, when I&rsquo;m
ninety-five you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Milly and Olly kissed Becky&rsquo;s pale little face
and went away, while poor little Becky looked after them as if she
was <em>very</em> sorry to see the last of them; and outside there
were Tiza and baby and Mrs. Backhouse and even John Backhouse
himself, waiting to say good-bye to them. It made Milly cry a
little bit, and she ran away fast down the hill, while Tiza and
Olly were still trying which could squeeze hands hardest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear mountains,&rdquo; said Milly, as she and
nurse walked along together. &ldquo;Look Nana, aren&rsquo;t they
lovely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did look beautiful this last evening. The sun was shining
on them so brightly that everything on them, up to the very top,
was clear and plain, and high up, ever so far away, were little
white dots moving, which Milly knew were cows feeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye river, good-bye stepping-stones, good-bye doves,
good-bye fly-catchers! Mind you don&rsquo;t any of you go away till
we come back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I should find it very hard to tell you all the good-byes
that Milly and Olly said to the places and people at Ravensnest, to
the woods and the hay-fields, and the beck, to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
parrot, John Backhouse&rsquo;s cows, to Windermere Lake and Rydal
Lake, above all to dear Aunt Emma herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you come at Christmas,&rdquo; shouted both the
children, as the train moved away from Windermere station and left
Aunt Emma standing on the platform; and Aunt Emma nodded and smiled
and waved her handkerchief to them till they were quite out of
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Milly, when they could not see Aunt
Emma any more, and the last bit of Brownholme was slipping away,
away, quite out of sight, &ldquo;I think Ravensnest is the nicest
place we ever stopped at. And I don&rsquo;t think the rain matters
either. I&rsquo;m going to tell your old gentleman so. He said it
rained in the mountains, and it does, mother&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
it? but he said the rain spoilt everything, and it
doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s that curious old fairy been sprinkling
dust in your eyes too, Milly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But something or other had been sprinkling tears in
mother&rsquo;s. For to the old people there is nothing sweeter than
to see the young ones opening their hearts to all that they
themselves have loved and rejoiced over. So the chain of life goes
on, and joy gives birth to joy and love to love.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
